1,Bad Day,Daniel Powter,2006,Daniel Powter,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/danielpowter/badday.html,"

Where is the moment we needed the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Well, you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
(Oh, what a horrible day)
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day
Had a bad day

3,Promiscuous,Nelly Furtado Featuring Timbaland,2006,Nelly Furtado,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nellyfurtado/promiscuous.html,"

Am I throwing you off?
Nope
Didn't think so
How you doing, young lady?
That feelin' that you givin' really drives me crazy
You don't have a player on the choke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke
You're looking for a girl that'll treat you right
You lookin' for her in the day time with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem I don't see no ring on your hand
I be the first to admit it, I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute
Promiscuous girl wherever you are
I'm all alone and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy you already know
That I'm all yours what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl you're teasing me
You know what I want and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll are you ready?
Roses are red
Some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead
But you're still kinda cute
Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level. Do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas
Last name Crowne
Recognize game
I'mma lay mine's down
I'm a big girl I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I'mma need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else.
Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?
Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean
Hey! Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean
Wait! I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my T-shirt on
I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's OK, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?
Promiscuous girl wherever you are
I'm all alone and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy I'm calling your name
But you're driving me crazy the way you're making me wait
Promiscuous girl you're teasing me
You know what I want and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy we're one and the same
So we don't gotta play games no more

4,You're Beautiful,James Blunt,2006,James Blunt,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesblunt/yourebeautiful.html,"

My life is brilliant
My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
You're beautiful. You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
Yes, she caught my eye
As we walked on by
She could see from my face that I was
Fucking high[Flying high - video/radio edited version]
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end
You're beautiful. You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
You're beautiful. You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you

Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting
We got the refugees up in here
No fighting, no fighting
Shakira, Shakira
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama (sí), bonita (sí), mi casa (sí, Shakira Shakira), su casa
Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (Sí!) and keep on (Sí!)
Reading the signs of my body
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)
I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby? this is perfection
Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing
And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl (Just smooth)
And everything's so unexpected – the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it (Let's go)
I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama (sí), bonita (sí), mi casa (sí, Shakira Shakira), su casa

Shakira, Shakira
Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)
Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)
Baila en la calle de día (Let's go!)
Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)
Baila en la calle de día (Let's go!)

So be wise (Sí!) and keep on (Sí!)

Mira en Barranquilla se baila así, say it!
Mira en Barranquilla se baila así
Yeah
She's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third-world country
I go back like when 'pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We lead the whole club jazzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats, boats (No fighting)
I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto (No fighting)
Oh, you know I'm on tonight and my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection
No fighting
No fighting

I am unwritten, can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
I break tradition, sometimes my tries
Are outside the line
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwritten

7,Crazy,Gnarls Barkley,2006,Gnarls Barkley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gnarlsbarkley/crazy.html,"

I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place.
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space
And when you're out there
Without care,
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly [radio version]
probably [album version]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
Ha ha ha bless your soul
You really think you're in control
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably
Uh, uh

They see me rolling
They hating
Patrolling they trying to catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
My music so loud
I'm swanging
They hoping that they gon' catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty[Chamillionaire:]
Police think they can see me lean
I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by they can see the gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Ride with a new chick, she like hold up
Next to the PlayStation controller
Is a full clip and my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some
But we packing something and what we have for 'em
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum security cell,
I'm gripping oak
Music loud and I'm tipping slow
Twin's steady twisting like hit this dough
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
Windows down gotta stop pollution
CD changes niggas like, ""Who is that producing?""
That's the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruising
Got warrants in every city except Houston but I'm still ain't losing
They see me rolling
They hating
Patrolling they trying to catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
My music so loud
I'm swanging
They hoping that they gon' catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty[Krayzie Bone:]
I been drinking and smoking
Holy shit 'cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home 'fore the po po's scope this
Big old Excursion swerving
All up in the curbing
Nigga be sipping on the Hennessey and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doing a hundred while I puff on a blunt
And roll another one up, we living like we ain't giving a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand,
40 oz in my lap freezing my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Coming pretty deep, me and my dogs, yo
I gotta get the back streets
Wondering about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock Glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me, on a low key
With no regard for the law we dodge em like fuck em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark,
Roll it up if you want, nigga, get it popping, dog
Ready or not we bust shots off in the air Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

Patrolling they trying to catch me riding dirty

Now would you think it so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sure, 'cause they think they know
That they catching me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rear view and they smiling
Thinking they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep trying
Steady denying that it's racial profiling
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And being the baller that I am, I talk to them
Giving a damn about them not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even riding dirty
Bet you'll be leaving with an even madder mood
I'mma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Yeah, my #2 on some old-school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, telling them, ""We hate you.""
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tipping down, I'm sitting crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, finding a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me I'm 'bout to pull up at your home and it's on[2x]
They see me rolling
They hating
Patrolling they trying to catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty

Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
Cuz a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase
Said we can’t see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It’s so true that (yes)
We’ve been through it (yes)
We got real sh** (yes)
See baby we been...
Too strong for too long (and I can’t be without you baby)
And I’ll be waiting up until you get home (cuz I can’t sleep without you baby)
Anybody who’s ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can’t be without your baby
I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? (no)
Make me cry? (no)
Do somethin’ behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)
I’ll be faithful (yes)
I’m for real (yes)
And with us you’ll always know the deal
We’ve been...
Too strong for too long (and I can’t be without you baby)
And I’ll be waiting up until you get home (cuz I can’t sleep without you baby)
Anybody who’s ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can’t be without your baby
See this is real talk
I’m always stay (no matter what)
Good or bad (thick and thin)
Right or wrong (all day everyday)
Now if you’re down on love or don’t believe
This ain’t for you (no, this ain’t for you)
And if you got it deep in your heart
And deep down you know that it’s true (come on, come on, come on)
Well, let me see you put your hands up (hands up)
Fellas tell your lady she’s the one (fellas tell your lady she’s the one, oh)
Put your hands up (hands up)
Ladies let him know he's got your love
Look him right in his eyes and tell him
We’ve been...
Too strong for too long (and I can’t be without you baby)
And I’ll be waiting up until you get home (cuz I can’t sleep without you baby)
Anybody who’s ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can’t be without your baby
Heeeeeeeeeeeey Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
Heeeeeeeeeeeey Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you

Yo we bout to start a epidemic wit dis one
Ya'll know what dis is... So So Def[Nelly]
Got 30 down at the bottom, 30 mo at the top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on da rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changin grillz errday, like Jay change clothes,
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh),
On South beach (oh) in my wife beat.
V V and studded you can tell when they cut it
Ya see my granmama hate it, but my lil mama love it
Cuz when I...[Woman]
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin (say what)
Eyes stay low from da cheifin'[Nelly]

My teeth gleaming like I'm chewin on aluminum foil
Smilein showin off my diamonds sippin on some Pinot Noir
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carrots 30 stacks let 'em know im so fo real
My motivation is them 30 pointers V VS the furniture my mouth
Piece simply symbolize success
I got da wrist wear and neck wear dats captivatin
But it's my smile dats got these on-lookers spectatin
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see mo carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowin givin everybody chillz
Call me George Foreman cuz I'm sellin everybody grillz[Chorus][Gipp]
Gipp got dem yellows, got dem purples, got dem reds

Boy how you get grill that way and
How much did you pay

13,Over My Head (Cable Car),The Fray,2006,The Fray,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fray/overmyheadcablecar.html,"

I never knew, I never knew
That everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears
And everyone knows I'm in over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
That's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the arguments in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between
And everyone knows I'm in over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on our...
And suddenly I've become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless
Without a sound
We lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves
And everyone knows I'm in over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
Everyone knows
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm over my...
Everyone knows I'm in over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this
(Enough is enough)
No more walking round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Crying over you
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me of what used to be
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)
Said I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishin' you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)
Why can't I turn off the radio?

Niggaz in my face
Damn near er' day
Asking a million questions like
Joc where ya stay
Tell 'em College Park
Where they chop cars
Eat 20 grand spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone jays on my feet
I'm on that patron so get like me
69 cutlass wit the bucket seats
Beat in my trunk bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood posted at the sto
Pistol in my lap on the phone counting dough
If a girl choose let her do her thang
Just like her mama nice ass, nice brain
Er'body love me I'm so fly
Niggaz throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why
I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what cha do (ok)[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Meet me in the trap its going down
Meet me in the mall its going down
Meet me in the club its going down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down[verse 2]
Verse numba 2 do the damn thang
Cubes on my neck pockets full of ben frank
When I'm in the mall hoes just pause
I pop a few tags give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work make the block bump
Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope Boy Magic seven days a week
Numba one record long as nitty on the beat
Oh I thank they like me betta yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggaz know my crew we certified stars
Valet in the front 'bout 35 cars
Bitches in the back
Black beamer coups
Girls like girls time to recruit
If ya got a problem say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place[Chorus][Verse 3]
Time to set it off let these nigga know
Have ya every seen a Chevy wit the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet
Feds on my trail but they don't thank I know
I keep my hands clean cuz I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em look 'em in the eye
Ask 'em how I know its me surprise!
Put it in the air rep where ya stay
Take a step back blow the kush in they face
Stunting is a habit let 'em see the karats
I'ma make it rain nigga I ain't scared to share it[Chorus][Outro]

Oh, well, imagine
As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor
And I can't help but to hear
No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words
""What a beautiful wedding!
What a beautiful wedding!”, says a bridesmaid to a waiter
""And yes, but what a shame, what a shame
The poor groom's bride is a whore""
I chime in with a ""Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!""
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of poise and rationality
I chime in, ""Haven't you people ever heard of
Closing the goddamn door?!""
No, it's much better to face these kinds of things
With a sense of
Oh, well, in fact
Well, I'll look at it this way
I mean, technically our marriage is saved
Well, this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne
Oh! Well, in fact

Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall everyone stands
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold
Speak to me, when all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along
So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold
Speak to me, when all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move along
Along, along, along
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through[x4]
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
Right back what is wrong
We move along[x3][fade out]

Getting born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper
And Mama was a hippie
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was
Anything more than poor
What in the world does your
Company take me for
Black bandana sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She’s a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin’
Baby what you gonna
Looking down the barrel of a
Hot metal 45
Just another way to survive
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She’s my priestess; I'm your priest
She’s a lover baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen it comin’ when
It got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
The day was gonna come
When I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded she was
Stealin’ another breath
I love my baby to death
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She’s my priestess; I'm your priest
Who knew the other side of you
Who knew what others died to prove
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say say say
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin'
For the quota
Down in the Badlands
She was savin’ the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She’s my priestess; I'm your priest
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She’s my priestess; I'm your priest

Niggas in my face
Damn near every day
Aska million questions like Joc where you stay
Tell 'em College Park

In 20 grand spend a grand at the bar
Just bought a zone
J's on my feet
I'm on that Patrone so get like me
'69 cutlass with the bucket seats
Beat in my trunk ballin just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood
Posted at the store
Pistol in my lap on the phone countin dough
If ya girl choose
Let her do her thang
Just like her mama nice ass nice brain
Everbody love me

Nigga throw the dueces everytime I ride by
I know you wonder why

Don't ask me just

26,What Hurts The Most,Rascal Flatts,2006,Rascal Flatts,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rascalflatts/whathurtsthemost.html,"

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m OK
But that’s not what gets me
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was tryin’ to do
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still Harder
Getting up, getting dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And having so much to say (much to say)
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do, oh.
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say (to say)
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that loving you
Is what I was trying to do
Not seeing that loving you
That’s what I was trying to do

27,How To Save A Life,The Fray,2006,The Fray,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fray/howtosavealife.html,"

Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down. It's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you
And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life

Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Whoa, anymore
And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
A murderer, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah

We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Honey why you calling me so late?
It's kinda hard to talk right now.
Honey why are you crying? Is everything okay?
I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud
Well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And, yes, I've dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me
Will it start a fight
No I don't think she has a clue
Well my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on

I still hear your voice, when you sleep next to me.
I still feel your touch in my dream.
(in my dream)
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why,
Without you, it's hard to survive.
'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last.
Need you by my side.
'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static.
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky.
Can't you hear my heart beat so?
I can't let you go.
Want you in my life.
Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky.
They wipe away tears that I cry.
(that I cry)
The good and the bad times: we've been through them all.
You make me rise when I fall.
'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling.
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly.
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last.
Need you by my side.

Do your thang honey!
I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Something about you caught my eye
Something moved me deep inside!
I don't know what you did, boy, but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since
Told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friends
Told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense
Alright
Every time I see you everything starts making sense
Do your thang honey!
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do

You got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man it's true
Alright

You're the light that I needed
You got what I want, boy, and I want it!
So keep on givin' it up!

Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other!
Ain't no other man but you, boy!
You are there when I'm a mess
Talk me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy, you're the best
You're the only one who's ever passed every test
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
(You're the kinda guy a girl finds)
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass
Ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you
And now I'm tellin' you, so, ain't no other man but you
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (what you do)
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class
You got style, you're badass
Don't you know ain't no other man it's true
Ain't no other man but you

She says she's no good with words but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out a joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too over-dramatic
Tonight it's ""It can't get much worse""
Vs. ""No one should ever feel like...""
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I'll write them
So you need them just to get by
Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
You always fold just before you're found out
Drink up it's last call,
Last resort
But only the first mistake and I...
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I'll write them
So you need them just to get by
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love
Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (mattress, mattress)
I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me
Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love (way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love (way they'd love)
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me

She take my money when I'm in need

(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her[Kanye West (Jamie Foxx):]

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)

Now, I ain't sayin' you're a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl[Kanye West (Jamie Foxx):]

Shake your money maker
Like somebody about to pay you
I see you on my radar
Don't you act like you afraid of
Shh...
You know I got it
If you want it, come get it
Stand next to this money
Like - ey ey ey
Shake your money maker
Like somebody boutta pay you
Don't worry about them haters
Keep your nose up in the air
You know I got it
If you want it, come get it
Stand next to this money
Like - ey ey ey[Verse 1:]
Shake shake shake your money maker
Like you were shaking it for some paper
Took your mama 9 months to make you
Might as well shake what you mama gave you
You ... you looking good in them jeans
I bet you look even better with me in between
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
But yous a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got j.o. on my right side pourin some cups
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't giving a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you was saying today
But don't forget about this feeling that I'm making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile high points you earn when we taking my jet
And how everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet..[Hook][Verse 2:]
Switch, switch, switch it from right to left and..
Switch it till you running right out of breath and..
Take a break until you ready again and..
You can invite over as many friends as..
you want to, but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you something to bump to...HEY
Luda...I'm at the top of my game
You want my hands from the bottom to top of your frame
And I...just wanna take a little ride on your curves
And get erotic giving your body just what it deserves and..
Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius...YUPP
Call me the renaissance man
Get up and I stay harder than a cinder block man....HEY
I'm just a bedroom gangster
And I been meaning to tell you that I really must thank you when you..[Hook][Verse 3:]
Rock rock rock it and make it work girl
Please don't stop it until it hurt girl
You..you been looking a little tipsy
So if you could just shake it a little this way
See I'm a member of the BBC
The original bread winner of DTP
And you the center of attention that's distracting the squad
Cause everybody in the camp is like OH MY GOD..she could[Hook]

Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Goodbye
Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we'd know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye.
Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me...

39,Because Of You,Kelly Clarkson,2006,Kelly Clarkson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kellyclarkson/becauseofyou.html,"

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you
Because of you

Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
She said, ""Some days I feel like shit.
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit.""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone.
I get along but the trips always feel so long.
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone,
But I feel like an idiot workin' my day around a call,
But when I pick up I don't have much to say.
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career.
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""
Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Please come back home.
Come back home. You know the place where you used to live,
Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs,
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile,
But now you only stop by every once in a while.
Shit. I find myself just fillin' my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind.
I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way.
You can call me if you find that you have something to say.
And I'll tell you: I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career.
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""
Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Please come back home.
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin',
Tired of sittin' and hatin', and makin' these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless.
It seems one thing has been true all along:
You don't really know what you've got 'til it's gone.
I guess I've had it with you and your career.
When you come back I won't be here,
And you can sing it.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so.
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone.
Please come back home.
Please come back home.
Please come back home.
Please come back home.
Please come back home.[Mike Shinoda, Brad Delson and Jay-Z:]

You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss (Ooh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I think I'll say yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I wanna be where you are
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing
Baby, it's so romantic
Baby, I can be in your heart
So many things I wanna tell you
I think that I should start by saying
Yo, whoa
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her (Oh yeah)
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss (Oh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
Now everybody just clap your hands like this (Like this)
Just clap your hands like this (Whoa, like this, huh)
And if your shorty's in the house tonight
Just grab her by the hand, homie, make her understand
Y'all was made to dance like this (Like this)
Y'all was made to bounce like this (Whoa, like this)
Just let her know she was made for you and
You want to do everything she want to, man
Ha, woo!

You've got your mother and your brother
Every other undercover
Tellin' you what to say (say)
You think I'm stupid
But the truth is
That it's cupid, baby
Lovin' you has made me this way
So before you point your finger
Get your hands off of my trigger
Oh yeah
You need to know this situation's getting old
And now the more you talk
The less I can take, oh
I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why are you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away
I waited here for you
Like a kid waiting after school
So tell me how come you never showed (showed)?
I gave you everything
And never asked for anything
And look at me
I'm all alone (alone)
So, before you start defendin'
Baby, stop all your pretendin'
I know you know I know
So what's the point in being slow
Let's get the show on the road today
Hey
I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why are you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away
I wanna love
I want a fire
To feel the burn
My desires
I wanna man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me?
Die for me?
Live and breathe for me?
Do you care for me?
'Cause if you don't then just leave
I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why are you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
If you don't have the answer
Walk away
Just walk (walk) away
(Just walk away)
Then just leave
Yeah yeah
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away

Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you
Well I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you
Come please I'm callin'
And all I scream for you
Hurry I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
And say it for me
Say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me
Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings I'm fallin'
And all I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And all I scream for you
Come please I'm callin'

What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it (Oh)
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny

This time, this place
Misused mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait
Just one chance
Just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know, you know, you know
I love you
I've loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming
You'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore
On my knees I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all
I'd give for us
Give anything but I won't give up
'Cause you know, you know, you know
I love you
I've loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore
So far away
So far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away
So far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know
I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
""I love you
I've loved you all along
And I forgive you
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing

Believe it
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go

Watch my life,
Pass me by,
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time
Are becoming clearer
I don't wanna waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes
Yeah...[Chorus]
Cause I want you,
And I feel you,
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger,
Like a burning,
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken,
And I'm faded,
I'm half the man I thought I would be:
But you can have what's left of me
I've been dying inside,
Little by little,
No where to go,
But going out of my mind
In endless circles,
Running from my self until,
You gave me a reason for standing still[Chorus]
It's falling faster,
Barely breathing,
Give me something,
To believe in
Tell me: It's not all in my head
Take what's left
Of this man
Make me whole
Once again[Chorus]
I've been dying inside you see
I'm going out of my mind
Out of my mind
I'm just running in circles all the time
Will you take what's left
Will you take what's left
Will you take what's left of me?
Just running in circles in my mind
Will you take what's left
Will you take what's left
Will you take what's left of me?

[Chorus: Ciara]
They say he do a little of this
He do a little of that
He's always in trouble, and I heard
He ain't nothing but a pimp
He got a lot of chicks
He's always in the club
And they say he think he's slick
He got a lot of chips
He's so messed up, I heard
He's been locked up, find somebody else
He ain't nothing but a thug
So what
So what
So what
So what[Verse 1: Field Mob]
And they say I'm a slut, I'm a hoe, I'm a freak
I got a different girl every day of the week
You too smart to
You'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard
That they say about me
They say I done this
They said I done that
But all of it's fiction none of it's facts
But you don't be hearing that about your love
You let it go in one ear and out the other
The he say, she say, they say, I heard
The beef ain't, we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes there
Nothing but liars hating I bet
They wouldn't mind trading places
With you by my side in my Mercedes[Chorus: Ciara]
They say he do a little of this
He do a little of that
He's always in trouble, and I heard
He ain't nothing but a pimp
He got a lot of chicks
He's always in the club
And they say he think he's slick
He got a lot of chips
He's so messed up, I heard
He's been locked up, find somebody else
He ain't nothing but a thug
So what
So what
So what
So what[Verse 2: Field Mob]
Mo' money mo' problems
Life of a legend
Haters throw salt like rice at a wedding
So what, that's your cousin
That don't mean nothing
Her like missing in a tight of affection
You get, you just blind to the facts
See the lies, just obvious drives for attention
You to the fine just supply your suspicious
But listen, say you love me
Gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess
Break up never, they just jealous
Drama for your mama, mean mug for your brother
I'm the author of the book nigga judge by the cover, yes
I-I been to jail, yes
I-I'm grinding for real and
I'm positive, they talking negative pimp
They hate to see you doing better then them, so[Chorus: Ciara]
They say he do a little of this
He do a little of that
He's always in trouble, and I heard
He ain't nothing but a pimp
He got a lot of chicks
He's always in the club
And they say he think he's slick
He got a lot of chips
He's so messed up, I heard
He's been locked up, find somebody else
He ain't nothing but a thug
So what
So what
So what
So what
(Ladies and gentlemen! Ciara!)[Hook: Ciara]
Some people don't like it
'Cause you hang out in the streets
But you're my boyfriend
You've always been here for me
This love is serious
No matter what people think
I'm gon' be here for you
And I don't care what they say
Some people don't like it
'Cause you hang out in the streets
But you're my boyfriend
You've always been here for me
I like the thug in you
No matter what people think
I'm gon' be here for you
And I don't care what they say[Chorus: Ciara]

He do a little of that
He's always in trouble, and I heard
He ain't nothing but a pimp

57,Black Horse & The Cherry Tree,KT Tunstall,2006,KT Tunstall,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kttunstall/blackhorsethecherrytree.html,"

Two, three, four.
Well my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking.
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
I felt a little fear upon my back.
He said, ""Don't look back, just keep on walking.""
When the big black horse said, ""Look this way,""
Said, ""Hey, lady, will you marry me?""
But I said, ""No, no, no, no-no-no.""
I said, ""No, no, you're not the one for me.
No, no, no, no-no-no.""
I said, ""No, no, you're not the one for me.""
And my heart hit a problem in the early hours.
So, I stopped it dead for a beat or two.
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done it,
And it won't forgive me after all these years.
So, I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree.
Now it won't come back 'cause it's—oh—so happy,
And now I've got a hole for the world to see.
And it said no, no, no, no-no-no.""
Said, ""No, no, you're not the one for me.
No, no, no, no-no-no-no.""
Said, ""No, no, you're not the one for me.""
Not the one for me.
Said, ""No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You're not the one for me.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You're not the one for me.""
Big black horse and a cherry tree.
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me.
Big black horse and a cherry tree.
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me.

Triple black Phantom nigga nah it ain't Tip
With Lucky charm diamonds and man but nah it ain't Flip
K bounce..ok then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car talk, and I bet my motor clean
Suicide doors, Brown Rover look like pok n bean
Erybody know me in the club cuz they smokin' me..Dro
Hoes scopin' me, ice come from Bo Bareeton
Hundred carats have 'em froze for an eon

Put them lights off in my rims, now I'm ridin' neon
Our cars look like cra-yon, hoes know I'm the man though

Ain't another woman that can take your spot my-
If I wrote you a symphony,
Just to say how much you mean to me
What would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular
Tell me, would you?
Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl
Like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
Saying ""I do""
Yeah, because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady

Ain't gotta do nothing crazy

And made you smile with every word I wrote
What would you do?
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team
Tell me, would you?
See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure
That baby, it's you

Alright it's time to get it JT
I don't know what she hesitates for man
Shorty, cool as a fan
On the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls real wild
Throw their hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And with friends so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I.
They call me Candle Guy (why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go? Why?
Me and your boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high? Man
Well, baby it's obvious that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla anywhere I chill
Just bring with me any pair, I will
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady

Woo! Shady, Aftermath
(Look at that bitch!)
(Holy shit, hey!)
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoe strings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up
(Now) Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish
Yeah, me and Nate D-O Double-G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna, finna
We 'bout have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' slut
Some girls, they act retarded (Man, I told you!)
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
(Now) Look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind
(Now) Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pulling me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go
Something keeps telling me that, me that
Everything's gonna be alright
Every time I try to leave
Something keeps pulling me back, me back
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be
You were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work[Verse 1]
It was all good at first,
Spending money, going shopping
Eating at the finest restaurants
And then from club hopping
She was right thurr with me bottle popping living that life
She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that I ain't like
We didn't have a worry in the world, got you diamonds got you pearls
But I can't help it if Ching-A-Ling been attracting all the girls
Baby I'm a superstar and that come with it
You got a good nigga on the side, you better run with it,
Even though I'm on the road doing shows,
I make time for me and her, relationship to grow
They tell me don't trust a woman in this industry
But she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me
Plus, when I'm outta town, always think of her
Might conversate with some chicks, but no one come above her,
(Uh) I thought I was your man
Guess you ain't understand,
N now I'm sitting here, looking crazy like
Damn![Chorus][Verse 2]
Walk in the house from hard work, my head hurts,
Instead of arguing, can I have dinner with some dessert (uh uh)?
She's talking 'bout this phone number she found,
Hey, give me time to put my bags down,
She's straight up, clowned
Before we end up fighting, let me leave,
I'm exhausted and this hurr, I don't need
Now I'm with the fellas riding and drinking
She's blowing my two way up but I need some time for thinking
(Yeah) I wanna go back, but something saying naaaw
Give her some space and the next day I might call
What should I do?
Look, let me ask you all
Should I stand tall, or let this relationship fall?
I ain't down on with having my feelings crushed
But it happens sometimes
Either love it or give it up
I thought I was your man
Guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here looking crazy like
Damn![Chorus][JD:] Chingy holla at them again !![Verse 3]
To all the fellas know you feel me, if you ever had a woman,
Good times led to bad times and you ain't see it coming,
Tried your best to make her happy,
But it wasn't enough,
'Cause mama told me in relationship the road gets rough
And I ain't the one to have my head down
Weak and stressed out
As bad as it hurts I gotta move to the next route
(Uh) I thought I was her man
Guess she ain't understand
N now she's sittin' hurr looking crazy like

Hey ya.

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track

That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the bitch you love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told young stunna he should switch to Bape
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy
Ooh, lemme slow it down for ya so you can catch the flow (catch the flow)
Screw it up make it go extra slow (extra slow)
Real girls get down on the flo' (on the flo' get down, on the flo')
Ooh, I gave you a taste you want some more (touch down)
On it like a pro
I ride the beat like a bicycle, I'm icy cold
Ooh, from the 6-4 hoppers up in crenshaw
The money making playas up in Harlem
Don't want no problem
We gon' keep it bumping while the 808 is jumping
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill[Chorus - Kelis]
Ooh, (I bet, I bet) I bet cha neva heard it like this before (this before)
My baby be cruising them phantom doors (phantom doors)
Got the bar popping this that you can't afford (can't afford)
Ooh, I'm drinking, blasting the crowds, it's all smoking
All the while I'm all open
Me and my girls we stay fly and we love to stay high
Ooh, from the 6-4 hoppers up in crenshaw
To the money making playas up in Harlem
Don't want no problems
We gon' keep it bumping while the 808 is jumping
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill[Chorus - Kelis][Too $hort]
It's 'bout time that she get with me

In fact, it's in the back bring 'em to the front (bitch)
Tell that man you's a boss, bitch
Make some noise, raise your hand if you's a boss, bitch
I don't think he understands you's a boss, bitch
Get some help if you can 'cause he lost it
Ain't no refunds, she spent the cash mayne
In your Benz with her friends in the fast lane
Flossing, you say ""How much it cost me?""
About a million dollars playa, she's bossy[Chorus - Kelis]

Hop out the ride n let the diamonds smoke off the range
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Chains so low you would think that diamonds never stop it
And it's funny cause you could never stop it
A bunch of rocks on my hand n I ain't even on the block yet
Show em white gold sorta hold em like my tims
And a chain hang 24 inches like the rims
Diamonds all blown up yeah sorta like a pimp
So when I like hit the ice
It starts glistening off the tims (off the tims)
My chain hang

Half blue, half red
Like my diamonds gang bang

Complimenting the teeth
Oh bra (boy) dats!
So check out my swag
Diamonds red, white, n blue like the American flag
Boy (do yo chain) is so colorful
N see I got that nice screen
My money spend on jewels

My music give you black eye
Cuz of the beating

I stay when n sometime you call it cheating
Yeah, my boys always around
Like it's a mee-ting

I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me[Chorus (2x):]
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'til you get sore
Smack that oh-oh!
Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the lac down
Convicts got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club now and wardrobe intact now!
I feel it down and cracked now (ooh)
I see it dull and backed now
I'm gonna call her, than I pull the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!
I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me[Chorus (2x)][Eminem:]
Ooh...Looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a little drink on
They gonna flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it!
Pedicure, manicure kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls
Trying to hold my woodie back through my draws
Steps upstage didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me and she's like ""You're!""
I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase
No time to waste back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
Plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing
""Akon!""[Akon:]
I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me[Chorus]
Eminem is rollin', d and em rollin' bo
And all marvelous them rolling
Women just holding big booty rolling'
Soon I'll be on Eminem throwing ""D!""
Hitting no less than ""Three!""
Block wheel style like ""Whee!""
Girl I can tell you want me 'cause lately
I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo

Damn baby
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...
As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school; and that's your favourite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool; and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don’t need a lot of wishes cause I’ll be okay if I get one
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I’d make you my whole life
And you’d be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I’ll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you’ll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don’t tell me what I’m feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn’t know what to do
I’d probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn’t be alone because without you I’m sick
Here’s my wish list
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don’t need a lot of wishes cause I’ll be okay if I get one
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I’d make you my whole life
And you’d be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish
I don’t even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I’d make you my whole life
And you’d be my wife, make it right this time

Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(A notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And, sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And, sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh don't mind me I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in, and sleeping for the wrong team
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And, sugar, we're going down swinging

I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round

(Down, down in an earlier round)
And sugar, we're going down swinging
(Take back what you said)
(Down, down in an earlier round)

I spent 20 years tryna get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I been there, done that
And I ain't lookin' back
On the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes
Spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I've had a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home
I been there, done that
And I ain't looking back
It's been a long long road
Feels like I never left
That's how the story goes
It doesn't matter where you are
It doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles away
Or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go

Come with me
Stay the night
You say the words but boy it don't feel right

You take my hand
And you say you've changed
But boy you know your begging don't fool me
Because to you it's just a game

So let me on now
'Cause time has made me strong
I'm starting to move on
I'm gonna say this now
Your chance has come and gone
And you know
It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say

You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway

It's just too little too late
I was young and in love
I gave you everything
But it wasn't enough
And now you wanna communicate

Go find someone else
I'm letting you go
I'm loving myself

But don't come asking me for help
'Cause you know

A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know it's just too little too late)
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway
(You know it's just too little too late)
I can love with all of my heart, baby
I know I have so much to give
(I have so much to give)
With a player like you I don't have a prayer
That's no way to live, no, no
It's just too little too late
It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know it's just too little too late)
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway
(You know it's just too little too late)
You know it's just too little too late
I can't wait, no, no, no
It's just too little too late
A little too wrong
And I can't wait
But you know all the right things to say
(You know it's just too little too late)
You say you dream of my face
But you don't like me
You just like the chase
To be real it doesn't matter anyway

75,Deja Vu,Beyonce Featuring Jay Z,2006,Beyoncé,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beyonceknowles/djvu.html,"

[Intro:][Beyonce:] Bass[Jay-Z:] Uh[Beyonce:] Hi hat[Jay-Z:] Uh[Beyonce:] 808[Jay-Z:] Uh[Beyonce:] Jay[Jay-Z:] Uh-huh
Ready?
Uh-huh[Beyonce:] Let's go get 'em[Jay-Z:] Uh-huh
C'mon[Jay-Z Rap]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B ([Beyonce:] Boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whipping curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back[Verse 1]
Baby seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you[Pre-Hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu[Verse 2]
Seeing things that I know can't be
Am I dreaming? When I saw you walking past me
Almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
It's like I'm losing it[Pre-hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu[Jay-Z Rap 2]
Yes! Hova's flow so unusual
Baby, girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro'
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce, flow, blow
What's the difference?
One, you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough, po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go
My dough keep the scales tipping like 4-4's
Like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever, that's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits, like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No Deja Vu, just me and my, Oh[Bridge]
Baby I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having Deja Vu[Pre-hook]
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Whoo...[Hook]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby I swear it's Deja Vu

76,Life Is A Highway,Rascal Flatts,2006,Rascal Flatts,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rascalflatts/lifeisahighway.html,"

Whooo umm yeah
Life is like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
Well, I wanna drive it all night long
Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You're in my blood I am not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long
There was a distance between you and I (between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooh, yeah
There ain't no load that I can't hold
A road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we're survivors
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long
Give me give me give me give me yeah
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long
Come on. Give me give me give me give me yeah
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
Yeah, I wanna drive it all night long, baby 
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

77,Call Me When You're Sober,Evanescence,2006,Evanescence,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/evanescence/callmewhenyouresober.html,"

Don't cry to me.
If you loved me,
You would be here with me.
You want me,
Come find me.
Make up your mind.
Should I let you fall?
Lose it all?
So maybe you can remember yourself.
Can't keep believing,
We're only deceiving ourselves.
And I'm sick of the lie,
And you're too late.
Don't cry to me.
If you loved me,
You would be here with me.
You want me,
Come find me.
Make up your mind.
Couldn't take the blame.
Sick with shame.
Must be exhausting to lose your own game.
Selfishly hated,
No wonder you're jaded.
You can't play the victim this time,
And you're too late.
So don't cry to me.
If you loved me,
You would be here with me.
You want me,
Come find me.
Make up your mind.
You never call me when you're sober.
You only want it 'cause it's over,
It's over.
How could I have burned paradise?
How could I - you were never mine.
So don't cry to me.
If you loved me,
You would be here with me.
Don't lie to me,
Just get your things.
I've made up your mind.

78,"Jesus, Take The Wheel",Carrie Underwood,2006,Carrie Underwood,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/carrieunderwood/jesustakethewheel.html,"

She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight
Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus take the wheel
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus take the wheel
Oh, take it, take it from me
Oh, wow, ohhhhh

Ladies and gentlemen!
Ciara[Verse 1:]
He said
'Hi, my name is so and so
Baby can you tell me yours?
You look like you came to do
One thing (Set it off)'
I started on the left
And I had to take him to the right
He was out of breath
But he kept on dancin' all night[Pre-hook:]
You trying, admit it
But you just can fight the feeling inside
You know it
And I can see it in your eyes
You want me
You smooth as a mother
You're so undercover
By the way that you was watchin' me[Hook:]
Ooh! uh
The way you look at me
I'm feelin' you, uh
I just can't help it
Tryin' to keep it cool, uh
I can feel it in the beat, uh
When you do those things to me, uh
Don't let nothin' stop you

The club is jumpin' now
So get up![Verse 2:]
I said 'Ciara's on your radio,
Everybody turn it up'
Spicy just like hot sauce
Careful, you might burn it up
You can do the pop lock
Rag-top, don't stop
That's the way you gotta get
Get it, make ya body rock[Pre-hook:]
You trying, admit it
But you just can beat the feeling inside
You know it

City boys say she fine a pretty
In the country boys say she fine and 'purrty'

82,Hate Me,Blue October,2006,Blue October,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blueoctober/hateme.html,"

(If you're sleeping are you dreaming
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me.)
(""Hi Justin, this is your mother, and it's 2:33 on Monday afternoon
I was just calling to see how you were doing
You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really OK
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and
Take care honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye"")
I have to block out thoughts of you so I don't lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you. Will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me, just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
I'm sober now for three whole months it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won't touch again
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, ""Make it go away!""
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered, ""How can you do this to me?""
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
For you
For you
For you[Children voices:]
If you're sleeping are you dreaming
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me[Girl:] Hey, Justin! [12x]

What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do, nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You got my head spinning
I don't know where to go from here
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do, nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you
Something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do, nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you
And me and all of the people with nothing to do and nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all of the people
And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you

Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with another one[Repeat 2x][Verse 1:]
Yea these niggaz like me, haters want to fight me
Yea these niggaz mad cuz I came up over night B
Yea I switched it up I got 9 kuffed tightly
So you betta do the right thing like Spike Lee
Yep I'm super clean rock jeans wit a white tee
Niggaz round here soft but like niggaz want to bite me
If you had some figures you would be just like me
Yea these niggaz mad cuz I shining like a light B
Niggaz talking bout yep in there muthafuckin throwback
It ain't real you know dats muhammadz where dey sold that
We stepping on these niggaz like a muthafuckin door mat
When I hit the scene they take pictures call me Kodak
These hoes goin crazy like think they need some prozac
We the hottest thing in tha market and you no dat
Yo bitch chose us and she don't want to go back
We stackin big faces cuz we still spending throwbacks[JD:]
Now when I do it its something like thrilla and manilla man
Known as a killa man fresh from the dealer man
So So niggas aint no crew illa than
10 acres of land and I got about a million
Dollars worth of cars in my front yard
I'm from a place in ATL where young niggas stomp hard
Ooo I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with another one
Remix we get busy over here
No sleep niggas stay up on they grizzie over here
We young (young), we fly (fly)
And we gon stay flashy till the day that we die[Chorus][Verse 2]
They don't want 2 fight me I'm snatching ya ass up
First nigga act up first nigga get bust
Majestic, gettin shredded while I'm twirlin n switchin up
T-shirt stravaganza (franchize the white tee boyz)
Self made self paid we lounge around in our white tee
Ashy black shirt well get down in ya brown tee
Muhammed throwback who'd sport a jersey by Ali
And if he make one (hell naw dat dont excite me!)
I'm all about my cash ride around wit a nice peace
Ear piece icy they straight up like me

Don't stand so close vision blurs when ice blings

It aint no showdown for no crown I'm holding that
Face all over VH paid great till this day
Been in love with the mic since Run DMC walk this way
Talk this way cause I'm gangsta, a chi-town legend
I'm not ordinary people its a star in yo presents
So icy that my earlobes hurt

Thick in the thighs can tuck that I stay on my grind

I'm bow weezy prince of the o-town
Just got the wheels clean so I'm riding slow now
I'm in a fast car something like a nascar
If you wanna know how much it cost you should ask pa
As far as the rocks in chain I dropped some change
Its easy for me to copped them thangs
And I dont stop I got rocks in rings
You know the same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front and the back yard
I aint got to act hard
I'm under 21 with a black card
Yea I know that was kind of a low blow
But the dough for the so so dont come slow[Chorus][JD:]
Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one

Dang, I know, I know but it's, it's just, it's just
Some things I gotta get off my chest, aight
Yeah, whoa, whoa-whoa
Listen
Baby, come here and sit down, let's talk
I got a lot to say so I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you
But you know, this thing ain't been no walk in the park for us
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so
How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
And everything I tried to remember to say just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand 'cause I know
There's never a right time to say goodbye (Yeah)
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye
Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I found myself asking, ""Why? Why?""
Why am I taking so long to say this?

Meant to crush your world and I never
Thought I would see the day we grew apart
And I wanna know
How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
Girl, I hope you understand what I'm tryna say, we just can't go on
Pretending that we get along, girl, how you not gon' see it? (Oh, oh, yeah)
There's never a right time to say goodbye

Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it
So we keep waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want
That's why we're waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
And we're still waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Now we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

Yeah...
It's my life...
In my own words I guess...
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made"", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?""
I don't know go play, Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-by baby...
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?""
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more. ""Daddy, you're lying.
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine.""
She's piling boxes in front of the door tryna block it
""Daddy, please, Daddy, don't leave, Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with you.""
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fucking walls must be talking, 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying, ""You've got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight.
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late.""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy, it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding.""
But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'.
""You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad.
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'.
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin.
I get the point. Fine. Me and Mommy are going.""
But, baby, wait.
""It's too late, Dad, you made your choice.
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us.""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes,
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes
And burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging,
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her,
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing,
So, baby, don't feel no pain
Just smile back...[*curtains closing and sounds of clapping*]

Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly
Time goes by so slowly

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do

Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you
I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day, but it'll be too late

I gotta stay high I I I I I I I I until I die I I I I I I I
I gotta stay high I I I I I I I I until I die I I I I I I I
I gotta stay high I I I I I I I I until I die I I I I I I I
I gotta stay high I I I I I I I I until I die I I I I I I I[Verse 1 - Juicy J]
Call me the juice and you know Imma stunt
Ride in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's the pump
Breaking down the good weed rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp tight girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chains
Riding through the hood got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same while I'm changing the lanes
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the creep
Vision messed up cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with D boys riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel but I know Imma star
Cause when I'm in the club I be back in the far in the VIP part everybody in the bar[Verse 2 - DJ Paul]
DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me
Nigga your green gonna get lit up
You leave your drink around me
Believe your drink gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me
And she bet she gonna get stuffed
These niggas is spies we living it live keep them nice tires
Riding around what they like
Make a couple of nuns a couple of dimes
It's purple purp purple purp purple and swallow it down
with the yurple yip yurple yip yurples
It's going down![Chorus][Verse 3 - Young Buck]
Puff puff pass nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high nigga smoke us one
Car pull out the phantom
Niggas can't stand it but them hoes gon' come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and Stack My G's
Stop at the light and pause on 3
Hit the mall and it be all on me
But gotta keep one eye out for the po-po
Close the window when I roll the indo
Know they mad cause I roll the benzo
It's that purple not pretendo
Three 6 Mafia and they my kin folks
So when I'm in Memphis, Ten-a-key
I just might not bring my own
Cause them niggas still let me smoke for free[Verse 4 - Crunchy Black]
What's up Mary! How you doing?
Mary Jane stanky nigga
Since I have met you girl you ruined my brain (ruined my brain)
You stole my heart (You stole my heart)
Right from the start (Right from the start)
So I broke you down lil mama put you in a gar (in a gar)[Chorus][Verse 5 - 8Ball]
Front row full of that dro
Leave the club full of rolls 8 mo
Yo girlfriend wanna ride with me
In the car wit a pimp where she supposed ta be
You ain't met no dudes spitting cold as me
With a bag of kush that cost six-fifty
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and choking constantly
Tastes like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That to me the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit, blow that shit out slow
Then pass it to me bro[Verse 6 - MJG]
MJ gonna sprinkle in some of that super incredible
Have a nigga running back
Where the nigga really good sticky number at
Cutting through the cigarillo like a lumberjack
In the morning what I need is to breath again a whole lot of weed
But maybe somebody can give me what I need when I want no less than the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J, 8-ball and MJG, and Young Buck we don't give a fuck
We must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessey
Nigga got a little hair on his chest
And we be like Bill Clinton girl take it out ya mouth
We'll shoot it down right on yo chest[Fade Out...]
I gotta stay high I I I I I I I I!!

I used to think that I wasn't fine enough
And I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't waste my time tryin' to figure out
Why you playing games, what's this all about
And I can't believe,
You're hurting me
I met your girl,
What a difference
What you see in her
You ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all
Just make-believe
Oh, love
Never knew what I was missing
But I knew once we start kissin'
I found love
Never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin'

So empty my heart, my soul can't go on
Go on without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around
Please tell me baby
Why you go so far away
Why you go

But I knew once we start kissin'

Never knew what I was missin'

Who would have known I'd find you?
Now you're gone, what am I gonna do?
So empty my heart, my soul can't go on
Go on baby without you
Rainy days fade away

Say you're here to stay
With me boy
I don't want you to leave me
I need you

It's just the cutest thing
When you get to fussing (cussing)
Yelling and throwing things
I just wanna eat you up
I don't mean no disrespect
When I start staring
Knowing that it makes you madder (uh, oh)
I'm sorry but seeing you mad is so sexy[Hook]
Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I ain't sure, but one thing that I do know is[Chorus]
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so damn sexy
When you're mad
Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact that your attitude excites me (so exciting)
And you know ain't nothing better
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex (I'll blow you out)
Then we forget what we were mad about[Hook]
Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place
Could it be the lil' way you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down
Baby, I'm not sure, but one thing that I do know is[Chorus 2x]
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you
And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you

But you're just so damn sexy
Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you

Hey T.I.P pimping
Hey shorty why you gotta act like that, I'm saying
I'm just trying to be nice to you[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no, wit a ass so fat
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that
In a relationship been faithful to a nigga so whack
Hey why you wanna go and do that love, huh
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that, do that
Hey-Hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that..aye-aye[T.I.]
Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo face
Now I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing that you need yo space
Selling niggaz is one thing you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between yo knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get yo knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I gotta mansion and a gate, you wit me you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck wit 23's the case
600 Gz in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like faith, make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad I'm making you stay[Chorus][T.I.]
Can he touch you like that, and make you make you feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it yo chest
Take advantage of what your concealing in yo dress
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you wit respect
Give you sex till you sweat, tongue kissing on yo neck
It's been awhile since she got it like this I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with yo panties so wet[Chorus][T.I.]
This nigga playing mind games man
I think the time came, that you mind changed you understand
Life is like a chess move, you need to make yo next move
Yo best move, keep it pimpin' you understand...hey
I mean you know what I'm saying I don showed you how I feel
You know what I'm saying, I put myself all the way out there you know
The ball in yo court man, but I just got a question for you...
Is you happy??[Chorus]

City's breaking down on a camel's back.
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack.
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see.
You won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free.
You've got a new horizon. It's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, they've gotta kiss me
'Cause I don't get to sleep, no.
Windmill, windmill for the land.
Turn forever hand in hand.
Take it all in on your stride.
It is ticking, falling down.
Love forever. Love is free.
Let's turn forever, you and me.

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats.
Lining them up like ass cracks.
Lay these ponies at the track.

I've never been
The one to raise my hand
That was not me
And now that's who I am
Because of you
I am standing tall
My heart is full
Of endless gratitude
You were the one
The one to guide me through
Now I can see
And I believe
It's only just beginning
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud
I guess I've learned
To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know
I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to
Walk the road that I believe
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud
Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you, do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been
Never been afraid of standing out

100,For You I Will (Confidence),Teddy Geiger,2006,Teddy Geiger,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/teddygeiger/foryouiwillconfidence.html,"

Wandering the streets, in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet
As what I can't have
Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair
round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you
What I feel about you.
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
and cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
Forgive me if I st-stutter
From all of the clutter in my head
Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes
Like a water bed
Do I seem familiar, I've crossed you in hallways
a thousand times, no more camouflage
I want to be exposed, and not be afraid to fall.
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you
If I could dim the lights in the mall
And create a mood I would
Shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah
That's what I'd do,
That's what I'd do,
That's what I'd do,
To get through to you
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talking that mess that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And, it's my name that's on that jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you

You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)
So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (mmmmmm)
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking (baby)
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags (You must not know about me)
We're finished (You must not know about me)
'Cause you made your bed
Now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah, Rihanna)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Good Girl Gone Bad)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Take three, action)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov)
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me (You know me)
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay—Rain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella—ella—ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella—ella—ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella—ella—ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella—ella—ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella—ella—ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella—ella—ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella—ella—ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella—ella—ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh
You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So gon' and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella—ella—ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella—ella—ella, eh, eh, eh

Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
Baby, come here to me
Come into me

Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
You can always come into me
Come into me

[Gwen:]
If I could escape I would
But first of all, let me say
I must apologize
For acting stank and treating you this way
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favourite girl forever
Perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
(sweet escape)
If I could be sweet (be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl
(I'll try to change)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
(whatsoever)
We can make it better,
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?
(sweet escape)[Akon:]
I want to get away
To our sweet escape
I want to get away[Gwen:]
You melt me down,
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Let's look for some common ground
So, baby
Times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waitin' on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me
Wanna take you with me
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favourite girl forever
Perfectly together
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?

4,Big Girls Don't Cry,Fergie,2007,Fergie,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fergie/biggirlsdontcry.html,"

The smell of your skin lingers on me now.
You're probably on your flight back to your home town.
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby,
To be with myself and center clarity, peace, serenity.
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you.
It's personal: myself and I.
We've got some straightenin' out to do.
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket,
But I've got to get a move on with my life.
It's time to be a big girl now.
And big girls don't cry,
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.
The path that I'm walking I must go alone.
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full-grown, full-grown.
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay?
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you.
It's personal: myself and I.
We've got some straightenin' out to do.
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket,
But I've got to get a move on with my life.
It's time to be a big girl now.
And big girls don't cry.
Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and uno cards.
I'll be your best friend and you'll be my Valentine.
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too.
We'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds.
But it's time for me to go home.
It's getting late and dark outside.
I need to be with myself and center clarity, peace, serenity.
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you.
It's personal: myself and I.
We've got some straightenin' out to do.
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket,
But I've got to get a move on with my life.
It's time to be a big girl now.
And big girls don't cry,
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

6,Before He Cheats,Carrie Underwood,2007,Carrie Underwood,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/carrieunderwood/beforehecheats.html,"

Right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky...
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey...
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo...
And he don't know...
That I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats...
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires...
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a-thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo...
Oh, and he don't know...
That I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires...
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats...
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No... not on me
'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires...
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats...
Oh, before he cheats... oh, oh

Hey there, Delilah
What's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away
But girl, tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
What you do to me
Hey there, Delilah
I know times are getting hard
But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me you'd fall
We'd have it all
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame
Hey there, Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
Oh it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
See you looking at me now

Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwing bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that
'Cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move amphetamines
Girl I spend money like it don't mean nothing
And besides I got a thing for you
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, you already know, girl[Snoop Dogg:]
Mobbin' through the club in low pressing
I'm sitting in the back in the smokers section

Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me but I can see you
(baby I see you)
It's cool we jet the mood is set
Your pussy is wet
You're rubbing your back and touching your neck
Your body is movin' you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin' you smilin' and grinnin' and looking at me[Akon:]
Girl and while you're looking at me I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby you got a phatty
The type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything
And that's kinda scary
'Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know

In the day
In the night
Say it right
Say it all

Or you don't
You either stand or you fall
When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for joking
There's a hole in the plan
Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh you could mean everything to me
I can't say that I'm not lost and at fault
I can't say that I don't love the light and the dark
I can't say that I don't know that I am alive
And all of what I feel I could show
You tonight you tonight
Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
But you got what it takes to set me free
Oh you could mean everything to me
From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth I could sing you
Another brick that I laid
From my body I could show you
A place God knows
You should know the space is holy
Do you really wanna go?
Three, four
You don't mean nothing at all to me
You don't mean nothing at all to me

And even when you look away I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time again and again (again, again, again)
(So come over here)
So, come over here and tell me what I wanna hear
Better yet make your girlfriend disappear
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again (and again, and again, and again)
'Cause she's like so whatever
And you could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about!

In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better

13,Makes Me Wonder,Maroon 5,2007,Maroon 5,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/maroon5/makesmewonder.html,"

I wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath
After that, after that
Try to get you back
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah
So, this is goodbye
God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no
So, this is goodbye
Ooh
I've been here before
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning
'Cause...
I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so, this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try
Yeah
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no
So, this is goodbye
Oh no
So, this is goodbye
Oh no
Yeah
So, this is goodbye
Oh no
Yeah
So, this is goodbye

Step in the club now and wardrobe intact now!
I feel it down and cracked now (ooh)

I'm gonna call her, than I pull the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!

Get a little drink on
They gonna flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it!
Pedicure, manicure kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls
Trying to hold my woodie back through my draws
Steps upstage didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me and she's like ""You're!""
I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase
No time to waste back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
Plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing
""Akon!""[Akon:]
I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me[Chorus]
Eminem is rollin', d and em rollin' bo
And all marvelous them rolling
Women just holding big booty rolling'
Soon I'll be on Eminem throwing ""D!""
Hitting no less than ""Three!""
Block wheel style like ""Whee!""

I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me[Chorus]

This is why I'm hot[Verse 1:]
This is why I'm hot
How I gotta rap
I can sell a mill saying nothing on the track
I represent New York
I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it
So I'm gonna bring it back
I love the dirty, dirty
'Cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce
As soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest
They love to take it slow
So when I hit the H
I watch em get it on the floor
And if you needed it hyphy
I take it to the Bay
Frisco to Sac-town
They do it everyday
Compton to Hollywood
As soon as I hit L.A.
I'm in that low, low
I do it the Cali way
And when I hit the Chi
People say that I'm fly
They like the way I dress they like
(They like my) my attire
They Love how I move crowds from side to side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply...[Chorus][Verse 2:]
This is why I'm hot
Catch me on the block
Every other day
Another Person another drop
16 bars, 24 pop
44 songs, nigga gimme what you got
I'm in there driving cars
Push 'em off the lot
I'm into shutting stores down so I can shop
If you need a bird I can get it chopped
Tell me what you need you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black meet on the ave
I hit Wash Heights with the money in the bag
We're into big spendin'
See my pimpin' never dragged
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me know I'm focused on my cream
player you come between you'd better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean the way you see me lean
And when say I'm hot my nigga dis is what I mean[Chorus][Verse 3:]
This is why I'm hot
Shorty see the drop
Ask me what I paid and I say yeah I paid a guap
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks 'round the way they call me cream of the crop
They hop in the car
I tell 'em ""all aboard""
We hit the studio they say they like how I record
I gave you black train and I did you wrong
So everytime I see 'em man they tell me that's their song
They say I'm the bomb
They love the way the charm hanging from the neck
And compliments the arm which compliments the ear den comes the gear
So when I hit the room the shorties stop and stare
niggas start to hate rearrange their face
But Little do they know I'm keepin' things by waistside
I reply nobody gotta die
Similar to Lil wizzy 'cause I got that fire[Chorus]

I was blown away.
What could I say?
It all seemed to make sense.
You've taken away everything,
And I can't deal with that.
I try to see the good in life,
But good things in life are hard to find.
We'll blow it away, blow it away.
Can we make this something good?
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around.
Let's start over.
I'll try to do it right this time around.
It's not over.
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground.
This love is killing me,
But you're the only one.
It's not over.
Taken all I could take,
And I cannot wait.
We're wasting too much time
Being strong, holding on.
Can't let it bring us down.
My life with you means everything,
So I won't give up that easily.
I'll blow it away, blow it away.
Can we make this something good?
'Cause it's all misunderstood.
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around.
Let's start over.
I'll try to do it right this time around.
It's not over.
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground.
This love is killing me,
But you're the only one.
It's not over.
We can't let this get away.
Let it out, let it out.
Don't get caught up in yourself.
Let it out.
Let's start over.
I'll try to do it right this time around.
It's not over.
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground.
This love is killing me,
But you're the only one.
It's not over.
Let's start over.
It's not over, yeah...
This love is killing me,

Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you babe
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find...
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same
Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, babe
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it

Just so confused about it

Should've known better when you came around (should've known better that you were gonna make me cry)
That you were going to make me cry
Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around[Comes Around interlude:]
Let me paint this picture for you, baby
You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes
When you cheated girl
My heart bleeded girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved
And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right
But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy
You'll see
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey[laughs]
See?
You should've listened to me, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Because

24,How To Save A Life,The Fray,2007,The Fray,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fray/howtosavealife.html,"

Step one, you say, ""We need to talk""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down. It's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you
And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life

I'm staring out into the night,
Trying to hide the pain.
I'm going to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing.
And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain.
Well I'm going home,
Back to the place where I belong,
And where your love has always been enough for me.
I'm not running from.
No, I think you got me all wrong.
I don't regret this life I chose for me.
But these places and these faces are getting old,
So I'm going home.
Well I'm going home.
The miles are getting longer, it seems,
The closer I get to you.
I've not always been the best man or friend for you.
But your love remains true.
And I don't know why.
You always seem to give me another try.
So I'm going home,
Back to the place where I belong,
And where your love has always been enough for me.
I'm not running from.
No, I think you got me all wrong.
I don't regret this life I chose for me.
But these places and these faces are getting old,
Be careful what you wish for,
'Cause you just might get it all.
You just might get it all,
And then some you don't want.
Be careful what you wish for,
'Cause you just might get it all.
You just might get it all, yeah.
Oh, well I'm going home,
Back to the place where I belong,
And where your love has always been enough for me.
I'm not running from.
No, I think you got me all wrong.
I don't regret this life I chose for me.
But these places and these faces are getting old.
I said these places and these faces are getting old,
So I'm going home.
I'm going home.

Ain't another woman that can take your spot my-
If I wrote you a symphony,
Just to say how much you mean to me
What would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular
Tell me, would you?
Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl
Like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
Saying ""I do""
Yeah, because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Girl
My love
My love
Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote
What would you do?
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team
Tell me, would you?
See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure
That baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for
Just saying ""I do""
Yeah, because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

My love[T.I.:]
Alright it's time to get it JT
I don't know what she hesitates for man
Shorty, cool as a fan
On the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls real wild
Throw their hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And with friends so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I.
They call me Candle Guy (why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go? Why?
Me and your boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high? Man
Well, baby it's obvious that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla anywhere I chill
Just bring with me any pair, I will
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(Love) My love
(Love) My love
(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

We fly high, no lie, you know this (Balling!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (Balling)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focus[Verse 1]
Ya boy getting paper (Money), I buy big cars (Foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (Choose 1)
Stay sky high (Twisted), fly wit the stars (Twinkle, Twinkle)
T 4? Flights, 80 grand large (Balling!)
So we lean wit it, pop wit it (Bankhead)
Vertible Jones, mean wit the top listen (Flossing)
I'm saying clean wit bottom kit
(Do It)
I hoped out saggy, jeans and my rock glistening (Balling!)
But I spent bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doing the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (What else?!)
Got my pedal to the floor screaming fuck the cops (Do It)[Chorus]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (Balling!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (Balling!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focus[Verse 2]
Slow down, tonight may be gone tomorrow (One Chance!)
So I spend through life like there's no tomorrow (Speeding!)
100 g's worth of ice on the auto? (Flossy)
And we in the street life until they call the law (Balling)
I made the whip get naked (What Happen?!)
While I switch gears, bitch looking at the bracelet (Got Em)
Step out, show me what your all about
Flashbacks of last night of me balling out (Harlem)
1 a.m. we was at the club (What Happen?!)
2 a.m. ten bottles of bub (Money ain't a thing)
And about 3 something I was thinking about grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (Twisted)[Chorus]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (Balling)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (Balling)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focus[Verse 3]
Nigga could you buy that
I keep 20 in the pocket (Light Change)
Talk a buck 80 if the Bentley is the topic (That grey poupon)
But of course gotta fly...? (Where?!)
To the hood to roll dice on the side of they curb
But I know a G Bent may sound obsurb (Get Your Money Up)
Drive 80 up Lennox cause I got on urge (Speeding)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous living in the fast lane (Balling!)
So when I bleep shorty bleep back
Loui Vuitton Belt where I'm keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over rucker (Let's Do It)
All guns loaded in the back motherfucker (Dipset)[Chorus]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (Balling!)
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (We in the building) [2x]
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (Balling!)

To get ourselves sprung
Oh we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together (last together)

That we was gonna see each other (see each other)
And then I came out

I am an arms dealer

Toot that thang up mami make it roll
Once you pop pop lock it for me girl get low
If your mama gave it to you baby girl let it show
Once you pop lock drop it for me maybe we can roll (oh)
Pop lock and drop it [8x][Verse 1:]
Baby Huey
Tonight it's gonna be some changes
No acting sadity
So stop acting and get it clapping
'Cause I'm knowing you feeling me
Yeah you cute
But don't let that shit go to your head
'Cause with this cutie won't do
Pimping another one will
You prepared rocking a skirt
And your heels so tall
And we ain't with none of that tricking but our bills so tall
I've been peeping you for a while and you're throwing it back
If you looking for you balla we got dough in the back
Look your color camello brown
And your skin so smooth
I'm having fantasies about what you and me can do
And you an undercover freak
You probably thinking the same
I'm seeing light up on your face because you peeping my chain
And I ain't tryna put you out there as if you a freak
So don't even take it that way just say you did it for me
And yeah you probably roll with me 'cause it's money in my pockets
So before then I gotta see you pop lock and drop it[Chorus 1x][Verse 2:]
Baby Huey
I ain't gotta be your man
But I really wouldn't mind
We ain't got to talk again I'm just tryna have a time
If you a balla pulla stack out and smack her on the ayyy
Pop locking cock blockas get up out the way
Let lil mami get low
Give a space let her sweat
The club turning to hooters 'cause they shirts is so wet
From the window to the wall
Lil mama showing her thong
The broad freaking herself it's telling me that it's on
You ready then we can roll I'm telling you we can go
I'm thinking if I can handle it the way you make it roll
You grooving and speeding up
You right in between us
If you a stripteaser then baby don't tease us
At first I thought I was tripping
But my vision getting clearer
You moving that thang around as if you practice in the mirror
She doing a new dance
What the next man said
I'm like naw she just pop locking on a headstand[Chorus 1x][Hook]
Make it roll to the left (left)
Roll to the right (right)
Pop lock and drop it get low a'ight
Make it roll to the left (left)
Roll to the right (right)
Pop lock and drop it get low a'ight
It ain't tricking if you got it
We got it but I ain't giving
Just bounce it and roll wit it and maybe you roll wit us
It ain't tricking if you got it
We got it and I ain't giving
Just bounce it and roll wit it and maybe you roll wit us
Pop lock and drop it
Now pop lock and drop it for me
Pop lock and drop it
Say pop lock and drop it
What's your name girl
Neva mind never mind
Do you thang girl fire you ain't never lied
What's your name girl
Never mind never mind
Do you thang girl fire you ain't never lied (Oh)

Runaway love

Runaway love
Runaway love
Runaway love[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Now little Lisa is only 9 years old
She's trying to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and ain't never met her family
Mama's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missing and nobody will listen
Mama is on drugs getting high up in the kitchen
Bringing home men at different hours of the night
Starting with some laughs - usually ending in a fight
Sneaking in her room while her mama's knocked out
Trying to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothing else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love [x8][Verse 2: Ludacris]
Little Nicole is only 10 years old
She's steady trying to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic step-dad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions she making up excuses
Bleeding on the inside, crying on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they always be tight 'til the end
Until one day little Stacy gets shot
A drive by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothing else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back.[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love [x8][Verse 3: Ludacris]
Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady trying to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's having sex with a boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep and she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection he's using no glove
Never thinking 'bout the consequences of her actions
Living for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out he ain't ready for a kid
Knowing her mama will blow it all outta proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothing else to do but get her clothes and pack
She say she's about to run away and never come back.[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love
Don't keep on runnin'
Runnin' [x4]
Don't keep on running
I know how you feel, I've been there
I was runnin' away too
I will run away with you [x2]
Runaway Runaway Love
Don't keep running away
I'll run away with you, if you want me too[Outro: Ludacris:]
Yeah, I can only imagine what you're going through ladies,
Sometimes I feel like running away myself,
So do me a favor right now and close your eyes,
And picture us running away together,
When we come back everything is gonna be okay,
Open your eyes...

I'm through with standing in line
To clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be
(Tell me what you want)
I want a brand new house
On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
(So what you need?)
I'll need a-a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet
(Been there, done that)
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair
And, well
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free
(I'll have the quesadilla, ha, ha)
I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me
(So how you gonna do it?)
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial
Well
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser
I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip-sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong
Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms

Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show

Better put your fingers back to the keys

One night, yeah, and one more time

And this crystal ball
Well it's always cloudy except for (except for)
When you look into the past (look into the past)

In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind, and get you out of those clothes

In this farewell
There's no blood
There's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth
Of a thousand lies
So let mercy come
And wash away
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come
And wash away
What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've done!
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
What I've done
Forgiving what I've done

Saw you switchin' lanes girl
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right

Tell me where you from, what you do, what you like

And tell me how they got that pretty little face on that pretty little frame girl
But let me show you 'round, let me take you out
Bet you we could have some fun girl
'Cause we can do it fast, slow, whichever way you wanna run girl
But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings
Do it how you want it done girl

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me

Come on and lemme show you 'round
Let me take you out, bet you we could have some fun girl
'Cause we can dress it up, we can dress it down
Any way you want it done girl
Or we can stay home, talkin' on the phone
Rappin' 'til we see the sun girl
Do what I gotta do, just gotta show you that I'm the one girl
Well I'mma freak you right, each and every night
I know how to do it insane girl
'Cause I can make it hot, make it stop
Make you wanna say my name girl
Come on baby please 'cause I'm on my knees
Can't get you off my brain girl

But that doesn't mean we should give up on love
You're the one that I've been thinking of
And I knew the day I met you you'd be the one

A millionnaire, don't spend a dolla on a hoe
And i'm still in here, tryna get a model out the door
How am I bother with the bottle of that dro
Slidin' on a roll, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know
And if I wasn't Banks, shorty prolly wouldn't roll
From the Benz to the lobby, from the lobby til the door
If you ain't with the program, now you got to go (go)[Lloyd Banks Verse]
I move like there's popo behind me
Cocoa inside me, so cold and grimey
44 beside me, hoes know where to find me
Where ever there's money, yeah i'm the shit honey (whoo)
Hood nigga with that rubberband brick money
If I go broke, I'll make you and your man strip dummy
Yeah nigga, you don't want it with them, there bigger cross us

Burns more then Ziggie (uh huh), the lil' niggaz dig me (whooo)

About to stomp me a bitch, put the pump to his lip

I never felt nothing in the world like this before.
Now, I'm missing you and I'm wishing you would come back through my door.
Why did you have to go?
You could have let me know.
So, now I'm all alone.
Girl, you could have stayed but you wouldn't give me a chance.
With you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand.
And all my tears—they
Keep running down my face.
Why did you turn away?
So, why does your pride
Make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie
What you keep inside.
This is not how you want it to be.
So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do.
Don't tell me I ran out of time.
If it takes the rest of my life,
Baby, I will wait for you.
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true.
I really need you in my life.
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you.
Been a long time since you called me.
(How could you forget about me?)
You gotta be feeling crazy (crazy).
How can you walk away?
Everything stays the same (the same).
I just can't do it, baby.
What will it take to make you come back?
Girl, I told you what it is and it just ain't like that.
No.
Why can't you look at me?
You're still in love with me.
Don't leave me crying.
Baby, why can't we just, just start over again?
Get it back to the way it was?
If you give me a chance I can love you right,
But you're telling me it won't be enough.
So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do.
Don't tell me I ran out of time.
If it takes the rest of my life,
Baby, I will wait for you.
If you think I'm fine it just ain't true.
I really need you in my life.
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you.
So, why does your pride
Make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie
What you're keeping inside.
That is not how you want it to be.
Baby, I will wait for you.
Baby, I will wait for you,
If it's the last thing I do.
Baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do.
Don't tell me I ran out of time.
If it takes the rest of my life,
Baby, I will wait for you.

And the rain keep falling even when it's draughted[Chorus][Fat Joe:]
Owwwww mami's body is banging, man, she got it, man, she does it all
She gets it popping with no hands, I'll make it pour
I'll make it rain on 'em I'll lay a game to 'em
I'm gassing misses to tattoo my name on 'em
Gotta get that baby love, gotta get my paper up
Gotta suspect me, exactly test this crack and want a ring on us
And you know what it is, yo, it's them powder kids
And we know how 2 bizz, so we don't give a shit.[Chorus]

Timbo.
Hey, Ne-Yo.
Say what? Lo-So.
Hey, hey.[CHORUS (Ne-Yo):]
I'm a movement by myself.
But I'm a force when we're together.
Mami I'm good all by myself.

You plus me, it equals better math.
Ya boy a good look but, she my better half.
I'm already bossin', already flossin'.
But why I have the cake if it ain't got the sweet frostin'? (yep yep yep yep).
Keepin' me on my A game (what what what what).
Without havin' the same name (they they they they they).
They may flame (but but but but).
But shawty, we burn it up.
The sag in my swag, pep in my step.
Daddy do the Gucci, mami in Giuseppes.
Yes it's a G thing, whenever we swing.
I'mma need Coretta Scott, if I'm gonna be King.[CHORUS][Ne-Yo]
First thing's first, I does what I do.
But everything I am, she's my influ.

She give me reason to not stop (eh eh eh eh eh).
And though I'm hot (too too too).

Mami be takin' me higher (ah ah ah ah ah).
I'm on fire (but but but).
But shawty we burn it up.[CHORUS][Voices]
Beside every great man, you can find a woman like a soldier holdin' him down.[Fabolous]
And she treats me like a Don, watches for the hit.
Checks where I go, even watches who I'm with.
The right when I'm wrong, so I never slip.
Show me how to move, that's why I never trip.
And baby girl, you're so major, they should front-page ya (front page ya).
God bless the parents who made you (who made you).
Middle fingered anybody who hate the,
Way that we burn it up.[CHORUS][Fabolous speaking]
Yeah baby, them lames you playin' with.

We tryin' to compliment you, you know?
Make it better.
Top-notch Tim.
Nice-look Ne-Yo.
Livin' good Lo-So.

Honey why you calling me so late?
It's kinda hard to talk right now.
Honey why are you crying? Is everything okay?
I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud
Well, my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
It's funny that you're calling me tonight
And, yes, I've dreamt of you too
And does he know you're talking to me
Will it start a fight
No I don't think she has a clue
Well my girl's in the next room
Sometimes I wish she was you
I guess we never really moved on
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
It sounds so sweet
Coming from the lips of an angel
Hearing those words it makes me weak
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful
With the lips of an angel
And I never wanna say goodbye
But girl you make it hard to be faithful

Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it
So we keep waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want
That's why we're waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
And we're still waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Now we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change

From underneath the trees, we watch the sky
Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you'd be mine
But here we are, we're here tonight
Singing amen, I, I'm alive
Singing amen, I, I'm alive
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
And I'm singing
Amen I, amen I, I'm alive
Amen I, amen I, amen I, I'm alive
And in the air the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along
Singing amen, I, I'm alive
Singing amen, I, I'm alive[2x]
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
When nobody died
And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be[2x]
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
We'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
We'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
We'd see the day when nobody died

Hey, girl, you know you drive me crazy
One look puts the rhythm in my hand
Still I'll never understand why you hang around
I see what's going down
Cover up with make-up in the mirror
Tell yourself, it's never gonna happen again
You cry alone and then he swears he loves you
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you, my friend, one day this world's gonna end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
Every action in this world will bear a consequence
If you wade around forever, you will surely drown
I see what's going down
I see the way you go and say you're right again
Say you're right again
Heed my lecture
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you, my friend, one day this world's gonna end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
Face down in the dirt
She said, ""This doesn't hurt""
She said, ""I finally had enough""
Face down in the dirt
She said, ""This doesn't hurt""
She said, ""I finally had enough""
One day she will tell you that she has had enough[Album version:] It's coming round again[Music video version:] He's coming round again
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you, my friend, one day this world's gonna end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you, my friend, one day this world's gonna end

Your subtleties
They strangle me
I can't explain myself at all.
And all the wants
And all the needs
All I don't want to need at all.
The walls start breathing
My mind's unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone.
A weight is lifted
On this evening
I give the final blow.
When darkness turns to light,
It ends tonight
It ends tonight.
A falling star
Least I fall alone.
I can't explain what you can't explain.
You're finding things that you didn't know
I look at you with such disdain 
The walls start breathing
My mind's unweaving
Maybe it's best you leave me alone.
A weight is lifted
On this evening
I give the final blow.
When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight,
It ends tonight.
Just a little insight won't make this right
It's too late to fight
It ends tonight,
It ends tonight.
Now I'm on my own side
It's better than being on your side
It's my fault when you're blind
It's better that I see it through your eyes
All these thoughts locked inside
Now you're the first to know
When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight,
It ends tonight.
Just a little insight won't make this right
It's too late to fight
It ends tonight,
It ends 
When darkness turns to light
It ends tonight,
It ends tonight.
Just a little insight won't make this right
It's too late to fight
It ends tonight,
It ends tonight.
Tonight
Insight
When darkness turns to light,
It ends tonight.

I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it
I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday knowin' that I won't
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it
And I know this much is true
Baby you
Have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move
But I like it
And it's all because of you (all because of you)
And it's all because of you (all because of you)
And it's all because of you (all because of you)
And it's all because…
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug
Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time I'm gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from
'Cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession won't let me leave
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it

racing, and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet I been in and out of relationships, I'm
starting to see thats it's me where the complications at, but I'm laying back praying that,
you can't have piece of mind of me, I thought I was right but really I'm wrong, in the end
I was to blind to see, I was in the fast lane chasin' my dream, and then it seem when the
fame and cash came they just got me going crazy lately, lately, lately I been so faded
trying to erase it but I cant cause the drama just goes greater and I been in so many
collisions from putting shit up till later[Chorus (Akon)]
I try so hard
can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it ain't my fault cause I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat getting dough[Verse 2 (Layzie Bone)]
It's like I'm taking 5 steps forward and 10 steps back, trying to get ahead of the game,
but I can't seem to get it on track, and I keep running away from the ones that say they
love me the most how could I create the distance when it's suppose to be close and uh, I
just don't know but I be out here fighting demons and, it's like a curse that I can't shake
this part of Cleveland and lord, would you help me? and stop this pain I keep inflicting on
my family hustling gambling, tricking and scamming scrambling and losing sight of what I'm
suppose to be handling, it's hard to manage cause everyday's a challenge and man I'm slipping
can't lose my balance I'm trying not to panic[Chorus (Akon)]
I try so hard
can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it ain't my fault cause I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow
but until then...
I'll be posted up right here with my heat getting dough[Verse 3 (Wish Bone)]
I see thangs won't change I'm stuck in the game as soon as I get out it keeps pulling me
back mayne got me doin' dirty dirt so used to this hustlin' money that I don't understand
how 9 to 5 work studied on the streets, hustlers know what I mean hustlers balling in force
I'm tryna make that major league so we never leave never, til' the sun came up gotta get it
nope no leaving no rush today games they play gotta go hard to get what u put in if you fall
off then it's all on you gotta watch what you sign to try so hard but I won't play the fool[Chorus (Akon)]
I try so hard
can't seem to get away from misery
man I try so hard
will always be a victim of these streets
it ain't my fault cause I...
tried to get away but trouble follows me
and still I try so hard
hoping one day you'll come and rescue me
but until then, I'll be posted up right here rain sleet hail snow

59,Welcome To The Black Parade,My Chemical Romance,2007,My Chemical Romance,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dirtyyouth/welcometotheblackparade.html,"

When I was a young girl, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Girl, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them? Your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade...""
When I was a young girl, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, ""Girl, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?""
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know
We'll carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're
Dead and gone, believe me, your memory will carry on
We'll carry on, and in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call
To carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're
Dead and gone, believe me, your memory will carry on
We'll carry on, and though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a girl, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a girl, I'm not a hero
I don't care!
We'll carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're
Dead and gone, believe me, your memory will carry on
We'll carry on, and though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on!)
Do or die, you'll never make me (We'll carry on!)
Because the world will never take my heart (We'll carry on!)
Go and try, you'll never break me (We'll carry-)
We want it all, we wanna play this part (We'll carry on...)

We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

He said I'm worth it, his one desire[Shakira:]

Why are we the ones who suffer[Shakira:]
I have to let go[Beyoncé:]
He won't be the one to cry[Beyoncé:]
Let's not kill the karma
Let's not start a fight
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar[Shakira:]
Can't we laugh about it
It's not worth our time
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar[Shakira:]
I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together[Beyoncé:]
I didn't know about you then 'til I saw you with him again[Shakira:]
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing[Beyoncé:]
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong[Shakira:]
We'll never know[Beyoncé:]
When the pain and heartbreak's over[Shakira:]
I have to let go[Beyoncé:]
The innocence is gone[Beyoncé:]
Let's not kill the karma
Let's not start a fight
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar[Shakira:]
Can't we laugh about it
It's not worth our time
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar[Shakira:]
Tell me how to forgive you
When it's me who's ashamed[Beyoncé:]
And I wish I could free you
Of the hurt and the pain[Both:]
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame

Don't trust him
Though I still love him
No longer want him

Got him on a chase like cranberry juice

Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go
The rain is falling on my window pane
But we are hiding in a safer place
Under covers staying dry and warm[Another version of the song says: ""Under covers staying safe and warm""]
You give me feelings that I adore
They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes

That you make me smile
Please stay for a while
Now just take your time
Wherever you go
But what am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way
I just mmmmm

Makes me crinkle my nose

I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green
I hope when you're in bed with her, you think of me
I would never wish bad things, but I don't wish you well
Could you tell, by the flames that burned your words
I never read your letter
'Cos I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer
Try and make it all OK
Does it hurt to know I'll never be there
Bet it sucks, to see my face everywhere
It was you, who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
And don't say, you simply lost your way
She may believe you but I never will
Never again
If she really knows the truth, she deserves you
A trophy wife, oh how cute
Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes, and he's through with you
And he'll be through with you
You'll die together but alone
You wrote me in a letter
You couldn't say it right to my face
Give me that Sunday school answer
Repent yourself away
Does it hurt to know I'll never be there
Bet it sucks, to see my face everywhere
It was you, who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
And don't say, you simply lost your way
They may believe you but I never will
Never again
Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you
Never
Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you
Never
Does it hurt to know I'll never be there
Bet it sucks, to see my face everywhere
It was you, who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
And don't say, you simply lost your way
They may believe you but I never will
I never will
I never will
Never again

Come enjoy the life
Baby take a ride
I just wanna vibe with you, you
Baby you and I can have a good time
Tell me what you like
Oo oo[Spoken]
Now listen
I've been single for a while now
And I've been kind of lonely
But I'm looking for somebody to talk to,
Love me, someone who can hold me,
Is that you?
I'm looking for somebody I can call boo
Looking for the only one that I can give my all to
Tell me if it's you, you, you
What you wanna do, do, do
Make your move
You can be my teacher
I'll do homework
You can give me extra credit, baby
I'll do more work
What you wanna do, do, do
Now it's me and you, you, you
Make a move
This mood is so right
It feels so right
You can be my prince

Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go
I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said 'no, no, no'
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go
The man said ""Why do you think you're here?""
I said ""I got no idea""
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my Baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said ""I just think you're depressed""
This me ""Yeah, baby, and the rest""
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said ""no, no, no""
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know..
I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend
It's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said ""no, no, no""
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine

[Chorus 2x:]
Do it [3x] what you waiting for
Do it [3x] what you waiting for
Do it [3x] what you waiting for
Now Lemme hear you say
Big shit popping, and little shit stopping [3x]
Ball on these niggas being broke is not an option
Do it to the maximum, take it why you asking them?
Don't listen to them suckers when they say you too irrational.
See I said I was king and them lames started laughing
Same sucker now I want the king on the track
I composed several classics, watch you know like ""Top Back""?
""Dope Boys"", ""Bring 'Em Out"" and ""What You Know About That""
Now they ask how I talk, what you know about that?
Dominated '06, now I'm going right back
See me raise hell, let 'em show just like that
Even Denzel say damn, I ain't know it like that
Nigga yea, still bank head you can tell
Ain't nothing changed but the name on the mail
Still kicking doors with them things in the air
Up in Beni Hauna's, see me slang in them chair
I will slang cane, no such thing as a jail
Said you need a hundred squares they just came off the scale[Chorus]
Do it like a ball player, when you see me balling
Stacks tall-ass ball player from the stage to the air
Whether in Miami, Cincinnati or in Riverdale
Arizona, California, make it rain anywhere
Pulling out that pistol nigga who you think you finna scare?
20 rounds of missles have you pissing in your underwear
I tote a pair of 40 cals, so you better tone it down
I suggest you just prepare yourself for when it's going down
A-town, west side, Club Crucial catch me,
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro & Mac be
Jackers lying say they caught me slipping how could that be
I'm something like a stalker I be everywhere the trap be
The trap be, jumping with that 100 dollar slab
If I wanted nigga I could get 100 on the tab
Sell em all double down Nigga do the math
Think I won't pull up in something With 200 on the dash[Chorus]
Do it like I wanna do it, do that shit in front of you
Real nigga vision pimping I ain't seeing none of you
I Do it for my nigga Phil daughter and his momma too
Do it for my oldest sons and they Grand momma too
Do it for my daughters and my my youngest son momma who
go buy what she want cause she know it ain't a problem to.
You do something to them and its you I bring the Drama to
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two
I do it for my partner go make show them nigga stunting too
We doing with them choppers, ain't no problem where you running to?
We do it for the block, now why ain't nobody stopping me
I do it for my pop, and my cousins too they watching me
I did it nonstop, now see how these niggas copy me
I made it from the bottom to the top, where I ought to be
Who do it this good, and do it different
No matter what I do you know I do it to death[Chorus]
Now do it!

Where you can stay forever

But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around

To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real

Paper bags and plastic hearts
All our belongings in shopping carts
It's goodbye
But we got one more night
Let's get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right
Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
Cause we are finally free tonight
Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side
We'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
And they'll think it's just cause we're young
And we'll feel so alive
Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
Cause we are finally free tonight
All of the wasted time
The hours that were left behind
The answers that we'll never find
They don't mean a thing tonight
Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say

It's 5 in the mornin'
And I'm up havin' phone sex with you, you (so horny, so horny)
And now I'm on the hotline
Over here lustin' for you, you (so horny, so horny)
Let's talk about sex baby, let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about bubbles in the tub, let's talk about makin' love
Let's talk about you on top or me going down
Let's have a little phone sex baby, on the hotline
On the hotline, the sun ain't up but, I had to call you
'cause I'm home alone lustin' for you
I'm in my room, nothin' but a towel on
Take them granny panties off put a thong on
I love it when I hear you moan
You got that sexy tone that makes the dick long
You're in a complete norther city on the fan line with nothin' but a baby tee on
You're the kinda girl that's sexy in some boxer shorts
I'm the kinda player that make you ride it like a Porsche
Yeah, I met you on my space
Now I'm 'bout to fly you out to my place, in the mornin'[chorus]
It's 5:30 in the mornin', good mornin'
I'm horny, I'm horny
I'm lonely, I'm lonely
I'm touchin' and rubbin'
Call me, call me, you're comin', you're comin'
Called you 7 times baby girl, don't stall me
I wanna kiss you from your temple to your feet
To the dimples in you cheek to the middle of you g-string
conversation underneath the sheet
You know me, redbull like an energy, I'm a freak
Baby girl said she loves phone sex
Say the sound of my deep voice make her wet
You call me 5 A.M. on the dot
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you with no panties, no top
Picture this, you say you're comin' over
30 minutes later you was parkin' the Rover
Jumped out the car and I met you at the door
3 seconds in the house and your panties on the floor
Kiss you in you mouth and your hips on my cheeks
Straight action on the carpet, rug burns on my knees
Now you're on the phone like damn I made a mess
Got my hands in my pants, man, I love phone sex[chorus]

High on the hills with the lonely goatherd, lay-od-lay-od-lay-he-hoo
Yodell back with the girl and goatherd, lay-od-lay-od-low
Wind it up
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yodellay, yodallay, yodal-low
(Yeah)
This is the key that makes us wind up
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch
But the girls want to know why the boys like us so much
They like way we dance, they like the way we work
They like the way the L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape (She's crazy, right?)
They like the way we react everytime we dance
Everytime the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop till your time is up
Get in line now
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yodellay, yodallay, yodal-low
You've got to let the beat get under your skin
You've got to open up, and let it all in
But see, once it gets in, the poppin' begins
And then you find out, why all the boys stare
They're trying to bite our style
Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room
This beat is for the clubs, and cars that go
Everytime the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop till your time is up
Get in line now
Uh, uh, uh, wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh
(Ya'll ready)
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yodellay, yodallay, yodal-low
Uh huh, it's your moment
Uh huh, come on girl, you know you own it
Uh huh, you know your key is still tick-tockin'
Hell yeah, and you know they're watchin'
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
To the front, to the side,
To the back, but don't let him ride
Keep goin' girl, it's your night
Don't let him steal your light
I know he thinks you're fine and stuff
But does he know how to wind you up?
(Come on)
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh
Wind it up, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yodellay, yodallay, yodal-low, hey!

Going hard when they turn the spotlights on
Because she moves her body like a cyclone

And she makes me want to do it all night long
Going hard when they turn the spotlights on

We're both looking for something
We've been afraid to find
It's easier to be broken
It's easier to hide
Looking at you,holding my breath,
For once in my life,I'm scared to death,
I'm taking a chance,letting you inside.
Feeling alive all over again,
As deep as the sky, under my skin
Like being in love, she says
For the first time
Maybe I'm wrong,
But I'm feeling right where I belong
With you tonight
Like being in love
To feel for the first time
The world that I see inside you
Waiting to come to life
Waking me up to dreaming
Reality in your eyes
Looking at you,
Holding my breath,
For once in my life
I'm scared to death,
I'm taking a chance,
Letting you inside.
I'm feeling alive all over again
As deep as the sky that's under my skin
Like being in love, she says, for the first time
Maybe I'm wrong, I'm feeling right
Where I belong with you tonight
Like being in love to feel for the first time
We're crashing
Into the unknown
We're lost in this
But it feels like home
I'm feeling alive all over again
As deep as the sky that's under my skin
Like being in love, she says, for the first time
Maybe I'm wrong, I'm feeling right
Where I belong with you tonight
Like being in love to feel for the first time

Got a thing for that thing she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see, just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking, all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you

I Just keep thinking about you (oh Baby)
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on (oh)
It's like you have some kind of hold on me and I don't Know (oh oh oh oh)
But I'mma go ahead and talk about it
Listen[Verse 1]
I'm sitting looking out the window like damn
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand
You still running through my mind when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be,
Me all on yo mind and I'm knowing that it couldn't be
Cause you ain't call and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lot of pain I ain't dealt wit it all
I been running round with other chicks, I'm single and they loving it, I'm liking it but I just want the
one that I was in love with.
That's not the end of it, I'm tryna let you go I can't,
Get a grip of it is what I'm tryna let you know.
You got a hold or some kind of control of me
I don't know what it is, but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm working at it and it ain't getting no better just tryna be like, yeah, forget it, whatever Instead
of staring out this glass looking at this bad weather, damn I gotta pull myself together
Cause...[Chorus - T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick,
Outta town visits, all the time we spent together makes it hard
to get you outta my system.
You know what you do to me (do to me)
You don't even understand (damn)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system.[Verse 2]
I'm too attached, my heart won't let me fall back
I got it bad, that's what you can call that (ah)
When I see you in the streets, that's the worse for me
Used to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you on my pager,
Know what you doing, where you at, or can I see you later? (Can I see you later?)
The fellas telling me 'just let her go Bow', believe me, I'm trying man, I just don't know how
(Just don't know how)
I be in all the top spots, leaving with the hot shots, knowing they just want me cause I'm in the top spot
That's not poppin and my brain ain't stopping, thinking
Who she with, or where she going, is she club hopping?
I never had this kind of problem in my life, this is my first time dealing with this kind of fight
It's every night and every flight and every time you in my sight,
Damn this ain't even right, cause...[Chorus - T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think bout is you (yeah)
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do (yeah)
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick,
Outta town visits, all the time we spent together makes it hard
to get you outta my system. (oh)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
You don't even understand (damn)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system.[Hook - Bow Wow]
Is it wrong for me to feel this way, you been running through my mind all day
Can you feel me?
I been tryna get you off my mind, but I cant after all this time
That's what kills me
Is it wrong for me to feel this way, you been running through my mind all day
Can you feel me?
I been tryna get you off my mind, but I cant after all this time
And it kills me[Chorus - T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think bout is you
When I'm all alone, that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiling faces in my sidekick,
Outta town visits, all the time we spent together makes it hard
to get you outta my system. (Hard to get you out)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
You don't even understand (damn)
You know what you do to me (do to me)
So hard to get you outta my system[Bow Wow - speaking]
I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole lives planned out together (oh oh oh oh)
And if I could, I would, turn back the hands of time and correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But now I guess I gotta move on, right?
It's still hard and I still love you till this day

Everything that we should be

And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
So, I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

When I sit alone, come get a little known

Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice.
Hey oh... listen what I say oh
I got your hey oh, now listen what I say oh
When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more - time to decide on.
When it's killing me, when will I really see, all that I need to look inside.
Come to believe that I better not leave before I get my chance to ride,
Well it's killing me, what do I really need - all that I need to look inside.
Hey oh... listen what I say oh
Come back and hey oh, look at what I say oh
The more I see the less I know
The more I'd like to let it go - hey oh, whoa...
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder where it's so white as snow,
Privately divided by a world so undecided and there's nowhere to go;
In between the cover of another perfect wonder and it's so white as snow,
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed and there's nowhere to go.
Ho!
Went to descend to amend for a friend all the channels that have broken down.
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up - just to hear you sing it out.
Step from the road to the sea to the sky, and I do believe what we rely on,

Took your mama 9 months to make you
Might as well shake what you mama gave you
You ... you looking good in them jeans
I bet you look even better with me in between
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
But yous a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got j.o. on my right side pourin some cups
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't giving a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you was saying today
But don't forget about this feeling that I'm making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile high points you earn when we taking my jet
And how everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet..[Hook][Verse 2:]

Switch it till you running right out of breath and..
Take a break until you ready again and..
You can invite over as many friends as..
you want to, but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you something to bump to...HEY
Luda...I'm at the top of my game
You want my hands from the bottom to top of your frame
And I...just wanna take a little ride on your curves
And get erotic giving your body just what it deserves and..
Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius...YUPP
Call me the renaissance man
Get up and I stay harder than a cinder block man....HEY
I'm just a bedroom gangster
And I been meaning to tell you that I really must thank you when you..[Hook][Verse 3:]
Rock rock rock it and make it work girl
Please don't stop it until it hurt girl
You..you been looking a little tipsy
So if you could just shake it a little this way
See I'm a member of the BBC
The original bread winner of DTP
And you the center of attention that's distracting the squad
Cause everybody in the camp is like OH MY GOD..she could[Hook]

This time, this place
Misused mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait
Just one chance
Just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know, you know, you know
I love you
I've loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming
You'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore
On my knees I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all
I'd give for us
Give anything but I won't give up
'Cause you know, you know, you know
I love you
I've loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore
So far away
So far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away
So far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know
I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
""I love you
I've loved you all along
And I forgive you
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go""

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky and I like it
Listen
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight
She looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight[Chorus 1:]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight[Chorus 1][Chorus 2:]
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows
I think that she knows
Now dance
Get it girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this one time[Instrumental break][Chorus 1][Chorus 2][Chorus 1][instrumental break]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh [repeat 2 more times]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
And now I walk around without a care
She's got me hooked
It just ain't fair, but I...
I'm love stoned and I could swear
That she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh

97,Better Than Me,Hinder,2007,Hinder,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hinder/betterthanme.html,"

I think you can do much better than me
After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
While looking through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were looking for
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
Wish I never would've said it's over
And I can't pretend... I won't think about you when I'm older
Cause we never really had our closure
This can't be the end
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
(And I think you should know this)
(You deserve much better than me)

I hold on so nervously
To me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far, has not been good
It’s been shitty
And I feel awkward, as I should
This club has got to be
The most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well I am imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place
Well I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
I hold out for one more drink
Before I think
I’m looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun
I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully
Be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well I’m still imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place
Well, I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
Well, I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

I pull up, whip low in the Phantom
With the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like
That's that shit
I'm in the back of the club
Blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like
That's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style
I'm like
That's that shit
Snoop Dizzle (Hey)
Your boy Kells (Hey)
Let me hear you say
That's that shit[Snoop Dogg]
Let's get this party jumpin'
Me and Kel gone get it bumpin'
They humpin'
Like when it's over
We gone all get into somethin'
The Dog is fresh
Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest
But these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess
That in the Chi is so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind
But Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test
You fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago
Let me get you to this real west
It's real strong
Real fat and real long
Doggies in the building
Holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it
Something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home
Work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown
Put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it
T-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin'
Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone
You might get this dog bone[Chorus][R. Kelly]

With the wheels spinnin'

Dip low, Six-Four
Hundred spokes and chronic smoke
All these ladies on the floor
Cuz they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball
Get your ass up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle
Now make that shit fall
Not just one, but all y'all
Move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me
Work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it
Is that your crew
Bring 'em too
Come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it
We can get this after party
Poppin' everybody
Got themselves another body
Knockin' out
Without protection though
That's my confession
But at the spot
If you just think
Your gonna listen
You can drop it like it's hot
Hold up
I came to cool out
Lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin
A couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it
But now it's known
That this cash shit
Kells sing that song[Chorus][R. Kelly]
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom
With the wheels spinnin'

Closed off from love
I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you're frozen
But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round
Thinking I'm going crazy
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal
Is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
And it's draining all of me
Oh they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars
For everyone to see
I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding

[Lil Wayne - Intro]
Uh-huh...No homo (Young Mula, baby...)
I say he so sweet, make her wanna lick the rapper...
Remix, baby![Kanye West]
Lollipop, lollipop
Breasts is just like Dolly Part-on
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot, 'til she ask
""How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take 'til she get to shop?""
Don't worry why my wrist got so freeze
Tell her, ""Girl, like Doritos, that's (na-cho cheese)""
Tell her friends, ""Like Fritos, I'm tryin to (Lay)
I cain't (only have one) and I ain't tryin to wait""
This a song with Wayne, say you know it's gon' melt
Butchu ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type of respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hunnid degrees, drop the roof, so the Coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold, chicken soup won't help
We need fo' mo' hoes, we need ohh-ohh-OH-OHHH!!
You know what it is when we're outta town
We ball in two seats, and you out of booooounds
So come here baby guuurrrrl
You now fuckin wit the best in the woooooooooooooooooorld...
Lollipop-pop...
The best in the woooo-oooOOOOOOOOOOOOORLD...
(Sh-sh-she lick me like a lollipop..)
(She-she lick me like a lollipop..)
Woooorld...woooorld...[Chorus 2X: Static Major]
Shawty want a thug, thug, thug...
Bottles in the club, club club...
Shawty wanna hump, you know I like to touch
Your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps...[Lil Wayne]
Shawty say she wanna lick the rapper..
And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flicking actor
I (Anita Bake) her, now she caught up in that (Rapture)
I got so much chips, I swear they call me Hewlett Packard
I got so much chips, you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy mutha-fudge cakes, now tell me how dat fudge taste
I do it for Bloods' sake, suu-woo think it's voodoo
How that roof do di-di-dissipate, your girl wants to participate
She so-so-sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then my diamonds are in the choir, because they sang from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang, because, all (she) do is (bang)!
Like Ricky Martin; Wayne and Kanye - pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-can't-make-an-appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it - remix![Chorus 2X w/ ad-libs][Lil Wayne]
Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I flushed out the feeling of, me bein the shit
'cause I was leavin skid marks on, ev'rywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it like, Hide-n-Go
And I can go anywhere, innie, minnie, miney, mo
I'm in yo', neighborhood area, CD thang, tape deck
IPod, ya gurlfriend and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'cause you don't want that late text, that ""I think I'm late"" text
Heh-heh, so wrap it up
Bu-bu-but, he's so sweet sh-she wanna lick the rapper[Chorus]
(RE-RE-RE-REMIX, BA-BAY!!)[Static Major - Outro]
Lick me like a lollipop...(lollipop...)
She-she lick me like a lollipop...(lollipop...)
Sh-sh-she lick me like a lollipop...(lollipop...)
She-she lick me like a lollipop...(lollipop...) [echoes]

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around and say
That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But that's nothing new
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry like an angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
Woahooo woah
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground

Head under water
And they tell me to breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me
It's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'mma need a better reason
To write you a love song today, today
I learned the hard way
That they all say things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart sinks deep down under you and your twisted words,
Your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry
Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
I'mma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
Promise me, you'll leave the light on
To help me see with daylight my guide gone
'Cause I believe there's a way you can love me
Because I say
I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
Is that why you wanted a love song?
'Cause you asked for it
'Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it
I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas
When I believe that there's a reason
To write you a love song today, today

13,Viva La Vida,Coldplay,2008,Coldplay,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/coldplay/vivalavida.html,"

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing,
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [5x]
Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

This was never the way I planned, not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you, caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

I liked it

Baby, you can have whatever you like

And, baby, you can go wherever you like

Anytime you want to pick up the telephone, you

Want it, you can get it, my dear
Five million dollar home, drop Bentleys, I swear

Brain so good could've sworn you went to college.
Hundred K deposit, vacations in the tropics
Everybody know it ain't tricking if you got it
And you ain't never ever gotta go in your wallet.
Long as I got rubber-band banks in my pocket
Five, six rides with rims and a body kit
You ain't gotta downgrade, you can get what I get
My chick can have what she want
And go in any store buy any bag she want
I know you ain't ever had a man like that
To buy you anything your heart desire like that
I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it

Let me put this big boy in your life
That thing get so wet and hit so right
Let me put this big boy in your life; that's right
I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody

Nothing heard, nothing said (Can't even speak about it)
All my life on my head (Don't wanna think about it)
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah
It's a thief in the night to come and grab you (Aha!)
It can creep up inside you and consume you (Aha!)
A disease of the mind, it can control you (Aha!)
It's too close for comfort, ah
Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise
Your mind's in disturbia

You're getting away, little drummer
I see your face through the numbers
The crowd is all over you
Move slow and I'll follow you
Playing the ground to the disco
Seeing the highest potential
I'm falling all over you
Move quick and I'll follow you
Lift me higher
So we leave angels on the ground
Hold me tighter
Let's not make a sound
Kiss me 'til I get the most
Light the chambers in my bones
Give me something that I like
Let my gossip catch your eye
Open up all of the floors
Orange is red now, purple stars
Let the blur fill up the night
Let the blur fill up the night
I'm caught up in the darkness now
I'm never gonna crawl back out
Come back to me somehow
I want you closer
Your whisper's blew me off my feet
There will be spilled streaming heat
Without you I can't think
I need you closer
Closer
Closer
Closer
You're getting away, little drummer
The magic night's getting colder
Sparks will fly at height
On the ground and I don't know why
Our voice is lost in the disco
Scattered around, I'm in limbo
I'm burned by fading lights
I run into the night
Open up all of the floors
Orange is red now, purple stars
Let the blur fill up the night
Let the blur fill up the night
I'm caught up in the darkness now
I'm never gonna crawl back out
Come back to me somehow
I want you closer
Your whisper's blew me off my feet
There will be spilled streaming heat
Without you I can't think
I need you closer

I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feelin' like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place
It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go
The rain is falling on my window pane
But we are hiding in a safer place
Under covers staying dry and warm[Another version of the song says: ""Under covers staying safe and warm""]
You give me feelings that I adore
They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while
Now just take your time
Wherever you go
But what am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way
I just mmmmm
And it starts in my toes
Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while
Now just take your time
Wherever you go

Ohbodododododododum mmm mmm
I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth
It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose
The feeling shows
'Cause you make me smile
Baby, just take your time
Now holdin' me tight
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever you go

I hold on so nervously
To me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far, has not been good
It’s been shitty
And I feel awkward, as I should
This club has got to be
The most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well I am imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place
Well I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
I hold out for one more drink
Before I think
I’m looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun
I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully
Be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well I’m still imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place
Well, I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you
Well, I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still

But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move

Can't help it
Can't breathe
When you touch my sleeve
Butterflies so crazy
Whoa now
Think I'm going down
Friends don't know what's with me
You got me tripping, stumbling, flipping, fumbling
So clumsy 'cause I'm falling in love
You got me slipping, tumbling, sinking, fumbling
So clumsy 'cause I'm falling in love
So in love with you
Can't help it
The girl can't help it
Oh, no
Can't help it
The girl can't help it
Oh, please
Can't help it
The girl can't help it
Oh, no
Can't help it
You know, this isn't the first time this has happened to me
This love sick thing
I like serious relationships and a—
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug crawls right back up and bites me and I'm back
Can't help it
The girl can't help it
In love
Can't help it
The girl can't help it
Oh, God
Can't help it
The girl can't help it
I'm back in love
Can't help it
Can't help it
The girl can't help it
Back in love now
Can't help it
The girl can't help it
I'm back in love now, baby
Can't help it
The girl can't help it
And now you've got me
You got me tripping, stumbling, flipping, fumbling
So clumsy 'cause I'm falling in love
You got me slipping, tumbling, sinking, fumbling
So clumsy 'cause I'm falling in love
So in love with you
Clumsy 'cause I'm falling in love
You got me tripping, stumbling, flipping, fumbling
So clumsy 'cause I'm falling in love
So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you

Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon, it's again my turn
To win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait
I'm yours
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
And look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
So I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait
I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate
I'm yours
But don't you want to come on and scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait
I'm yours
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't, please don't, please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh, this oh, this is our fate
I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours?
You best believe, you best believe, I'm yours

Oh, oh, oh
No matter what you say about love
I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire
Sooner or later, I'll get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life
I learn every time I bleed
That truth is a stranger
Soul is in danger, I gotta let my spirit be free
To admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry but I have to move on
And leave you behind[Chorus:]
I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize, nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back got a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
(Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you
I'll always have you, I'll always have you)
I'm sick of playing all of these games
It's not about taking sides
When I looked in the mirror, didn't deliver
It hurt enough to think that I could
Stop, admit that I'm wrong
And then change my mind
Sorry but I gotta be strong
And leave you behind[Chorus:]
I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize, nothing's broken
No need to worry 'bout everything I've done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back got a new direction
I loved you once, needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
(Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you
I'll always have you)
If I live every moment
Won't change any moment
Still a part of me in you
I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do[Chorus x2]
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you

You're gonna be a shining star with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.
'Cause everyone knows just who you are-are.
So live your life, ay, ay, ay.
You steady chasing that paper.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
Ain't got no time for no haters.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
No telling where it'll take you.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.

Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)[T.I.:]
Never mind what haters say,
Ignore them 'til they fade away.
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away.
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today.
You still be wasting days away, nah had I never saved the day.
Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay.
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way.
I never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way.
Some say they sold the yay and no they couldn't even work on Labor Day.
It ain't that black and white, it has an area that's shaded grey.
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away.
Some move away to make a way not move away 'cause they afraid.
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away.
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt their face away.
Like I once made them spray, now I could make them plead their case away.
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break.
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away.[Rihanna:]
You're gonna be a shining star, with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.

No telling where it'll take you.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
'Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life.[T.I.:]
I'm the opposite of moderate,
Immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid.
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics.
Articulate but still would grab a nigga by the collar quick.
Whoever having problems with their record sales just holla tip.
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow tip.
I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it.
Could do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy.
The hootin' and the hollerin' back and forth with the arguing.
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in.
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'.
The cheques into your bank account and you up out of poverty.
Your values is a disarray, prioritizing horribly.
Unhappy with the riches 'cause your piss poor morally.
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning.
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden aren't we?[Rihanna:]
You're gonna be a shining star, with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.
'Cause everyone knows, who you are-are.
So live your life, ay, ay, ay.
You steady chasing that paper.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
No telling where it'll take you.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
'Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
Now everybody watchin' what I do.
Come walk in my shoes,
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to.
I got my mind on my money and I not goin' away.
So keep on gettin' your paper and keep on climbin'.
Look in the mirror and keep on shinin'.
'Til the game ends, 'til the clock stops.

I'll show you to my brethren.
I'm liking this American boy, American boy.
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American boy, American boy[Estelle:]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
Will you be my American boy, American boy?
Can we get away this weekend?
Take me to Broadway.
Let's go shopping, maybe, then we'll go to a café.
Let's go on the subway.
Take me to your hood.
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good.
Dress in all your fancy clothes.
Sneakers looking fresh to death.
I'm loving those Shell Toes.
Walking that walk.
Talk that slick talk.
I'm liking this American boy, American boy.
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American boy.
Tell 'em wagwan blud.[Kanye West:]
Who killing 'em in the UK.
Everybody gonna say, ""You, K.""
Reluctantly 'cause most of this press don't fuck with me.
Estelle once said to me, ""Cool down, down,
Don't act a fool now, now.""
I always act a fool. Oww, oww.
Ain't nothing new now now.
He crazy. I know what you thinking.
Ribena I know what you're drinking.
Rap singer. Chain blinger.
Holler at the next chick soon as you're blinking.
What's your persona
About this Americana rhymer?
Am I shallow 'cause all my clothes designer.
Dressed smart like a London bloke.
Yes.
Before he speak his suit bespoke.
And you thought he was cute before.
Look at this peacoat, tell me he's broke.
And I know you ain't into all that.
I heard your lyrics I feel your spirit.
But I still talk that cash
'Cause a lot of wags wanna hear it.
And I'm feeling like Mike at his baddest.
Like The Pips at they Gladys.
And I know they love it.
So to hell with all that rubbish.[Estelle:]
Would you be my love, my love?
Could you be mine?
Would you be my love, my love?
Could you be mine?
Could you be my love, my love?
Would you be my American boy, American boy?
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to Chicago, San Francisco Bay.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American boy, be my American boy.
American boy.
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day.
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA.
I really want to come kick it with you.
You'll be my American boy.
American boy.[Estelle:]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing
I was just thinking
How we don't have a song""
And he says...[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have.""
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again
I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway,
Well, on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice
All the roses
And the note that said...
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have""
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have""
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again
Oh, yeah...
Oh-oh, yeah
I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

Do, do you got a first-aid kit handy?
Do, do you know how to patch up a wound?

And I, I've tried every remedy
And nothing seems to work for me

And I really wanna be your lady, lady

That my heart is damaged, damaged

Young Money
Ya Dig
Mack, I'm going in
A millionaire, I'm a young money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career this isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet
In my mind 'cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch, ch, ch, ch chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father mothafuck a coppa
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers hahahaha you can't catch 'em, you can't stop 'em
I go by them goon rules if you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em then you mop 'em,
You can't stand 'em then you drop 'em,
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher!
Motherfucker I'm ill
A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair
With coke in the derrière
Like smoke in the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini hopin' them crackers see me
Like look at that bastard weezy
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a motherfucking problem
OK, you're a goon but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothing, nothing -- you ain't scarin' nothing
On some faggot bullshit call him Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want bitch, call me on my sidekick
Never answer when it's private, damn I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch?
Yeah I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to my bitch
Hahahaha, yeah, nigga that's my bitch
So when she ask for the money, when you through don't be surprised bitch
It ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass, you ain't got shit
Motherfucker I'm ill, not sick
And I'm OK but my watch sick, yeah my drop sick, yeah my Glock sick and my knot thick
I'm it!
Motherfucker I'm ill!
Yeah
See..
They say I'm rapping like Big, Jay and Tupac, Andre 3000 where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that say they're gonna beat Lil' Wayne
My name ain't BIC, but I keep that flame man
Who that one that do that boy?
You knew that
True that swallow
And I be the shit now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
Ha ha, and I'd rather be pushing flowers
Than to be in the pen sharing showers
Ha, Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowry
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips poking out the coup look like it's pouting
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it bitch
I could turn a crack rock into a mountain, dare me
Don't you compare me 'cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me, but they hear me
They don't feel me, but they fear me.

Oh I had a lot to say
Was thinking all my time away
I missed you and things weren't the same
'Cause everything inside
It never comes out right
And when I see you cry
It makes me wanna die
I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry 'bout all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say ""I'm sorry""
This time I think I'm to blame
It's harder to get through the days
You get older and blame turns to shame
'Cause everything inside
It never comes out right
And when I see you cry
It makes me wanna die
I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry 'bout all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss, I love all your sounds
And baby the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say ""I'm sorry""
Every single day
I think about how we came all this way
The sleepless nights
And the tears you've cried
It's never too late to make it right
Oh yeah sorry!
I'm sorry I'm bad, I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry 'bout all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back

Independent do you know what that mean? [Repeat 2x]
She got to her own house
She got her own car
Two jobs work hard you a bad broad
If you ain't on sit down [Repeat 4x][Verse 1: Webbie]
Independent do you know what that mean?
Baby Phat just relaxed
Front your own flat screen
Fat Folks Cook or clean that a maka maka seen
When you're calling her on her cellular she tells you she needs not a god damn thing
You a hot damn thing
If you think you finna get her with a god damn chain
You're insane boy, you better get some god damn chains
He a fool up in the school
Even walked across the stage
And she says I love Webbie
From his looks to his waves
The stilettos the J's depend on how the weather look
Flip flop slippers just to show off the pedicure
Flip flop niggas just depend on how the cheddar look
She'll buy her own I don't think she'll never look
In a man face standing waiting for him to take care of her
She'll rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule[Chorus][Verse 2: Lil Phat]
She a dome dime diva
Gotta like Keisha
Work that meter
'cause she a good freaka
'cause she stay on her shit
She got her own shit
She don't never trip 'cause all she want is that dick
She bouncy flossy keep them hoes off me
Gotta little slang man I love when she talking
A independent chick do you know what that mean
She cook she clean never smell like onion rings
22's on her whip
Oh she do it large (she do it large)
When she break a nigga off
Get a nigga spoiled
She a bad Lil chick
A fly little chick
Hit me on my phone she like to ride dick
Got her stunner shades on looking like something
Staying young hair long she a nice something
Like to go to the mall everyday for an outfit
Hair did, nails did, independent what she call it[Chorus][Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
She got her own house
Drive her own whip
Range rover all white... like her toe tips
She got a pretty smile smell real good
Only time she need a man for that good drill
They by the bar to
They superstars to
They be like you ain't got no money take you broke tail home
In baby phat they on
They cloths match they phone
They be like YEAH!!! when they song come on
Leave the club kinda early
'cause they gotta go to work
I mess with supervisors who got credit like they perfect
So dusty feet please don't bother me
I got independent dimes on my mind...who spoil me
Gucci hat...Gucci fit so sick
That's a gift from my independent chick that serve
Tryna get me next to her gotta be yourself mayne 'cause she got her own money she don't need no help mayne.[Chorus]

No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?

And no longer were you with me

So every time you hold me

Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again

How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it?
That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
And you're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
So, I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

I fake a smile so he won't see

Yes this is true 'cause what I do, no one can do it better
You can talk about me
'Cause I'm a hot topic
I see you watching me, watching me, and I know you want it
When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies
When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies
When I grow up
Be on TV
People know me
Be on magazines
When I grow up
Fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene
Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
Be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
Get it!

Konvict (Konvict)
Oh [8x][Colby:]
I peeped you on the phone
Just showin' off your stone
And noticed that,
That pinky ring is bright enough baby
I know you're not alone
But I could just be wrong
The way them fellas houndin'
And sizing you up baby
And I like the way you take advantage of every man you love
I see, and I know your game girl
But I don't mind if you come and play with us, just don't talk too much
I see you, you're so cute, you don't have to say a word[Hook:]
Yeah those guys wanna come treat you right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always taking on the spotlight
Always in the club looking hot
Girl you know that you need to stop[Chorus:]
Always talking about what you got
Always talking about what you got
Always talking about what you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talking about what you got
Always talking about what you got
Always talking about what you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Girl I can tell you want somethin' to love
That's why you hold on to everything that pass you by
Can't resist girl, and I can't lie and I can tell if you are here for me
Or everybody watchin' you shake from left to right
The way you move got me hypnotized
And I like the way you take advantage of every man you love
I see, and I know your game girl
But I don't mind if you come and play with us, just don't talk too much
I see (I see it), so you don't have to say a word[Hook][Chorus][Akon:]
Can't keep my eyes away from you girl
When you get on the floor
And do what you do
And everybody want to come back to that body
That kind of remind myself I like you
Be sure that type drive a man crazy and snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back
He'll end up callin' you baby
And they never really know what to do
Once you expose that thing you do
You had him crawlin' on his hands and knees
And you find a way to get him out of that cheese
And why you thinkin' you're the only dude
She off in the mall livin' off of you
Lettin' everybody know she got you
But now you feel like a fool[Hook][Chorus]

Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me in love and all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the current's only pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I will be going under
Can you save me from this?
'Cause it's not my time I'm not going
There's a fear in me it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh but I won't go
I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take them away
Oh but I'm taking them back
'Cause all of this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend, this life we live, it's not what we have
It's what we believe in
It's not my time I'm not going
There's a fear in me but it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But it's not my time I'm not going
There's a will in me and now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh but I won't go
I won't go
There might be more than you believe
(There might be more than you believe)
There might be more than you can see
But it's not my time I'm not going
There's a fear in me it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But it's not my time I'm not going
There's a will in me and now it's gonna show
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh
There might be more than you believe

There might be more than you can see

It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to
See, somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through
Going, coming, thought I heard a knock
Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know
If you didn't notice
You mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be OK
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time
I couldn't turn on the TV
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings?
If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings but that's the path
I believe in
And I know that time will heal it
If you didn't notice
Boy you meant everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be OK
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time
Since there's no more you and me
(no more you and me)
It's time I let you go so I can be free
And live my life how it should be
(but I know, but know)
No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you
Yes, I will
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
Yes, I do
It'll all get better in time
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
Even though I really love you
Gonna smile 'cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

I close both locks below the window
I close both blinds and turn away
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way
And the sun will set for you

And the sun will set for you
In cards and flowers on your window
Your friends all plead for you to stay
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way
And the sun will set for you
The sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey

[Intro:][Niia]
Ah ah ah ah[Wyclef Jean (Lil Wayne)]
Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill
She whine for the bill
Grind for the bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
(and she used to be the sweetest girl)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill[Verse 1: (Wyclef Jean)]
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)[Chorus: Akon (x2)]
See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)[Verse 2: (Akon)]
Pimpin' got harder cause hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shakin' for a dub
Then triple times the money and spending it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow
You getting' pressure from cops
You don't know not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
To all my real gorillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women getting' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry[Chorus: Akon (x2)]
Cos' I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)[Bridge: (Wyclef Jean)]
Money, money-money-money
Money, money-money-money
It drives the world crazy[Verse 3: (Lil Wayne)][Niia] She used to be[Weezy] She used to be the sweetest girl
She used to be the sweetest girl ever, ever
Now she like sour ameretta
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She takes a loss cos she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him... where my money at?[Chorus: Akon (x2)]
Cos' I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all (dollar, dollar bill y'all)[Outro: (Wyclef Jean)]
Some live for the bill
Some kill for the bill (oh where my money at?)
She whine for the bill
Grind for the bill (oh where my money at?)
Some steal for the bill,
If they got to pay the bill (oh where my money at?)
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill

And I can't figure it out
There's something about her.
Said ooh it's something about
The kind of woman that want you but don't need you
Hey I can't figure it out
There's something about her
'Cause she walk like a boss
Talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
And she move like a boss
Do what a boss do
She got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kind of girl I need
She got her own thing
That's why I love her

Won't you come and spend a little time

There's something about her
'Cause she work like a boss
Play like a boss
Car and a crib she 'bout to pay 'em both off
And the bills are paid on time
She made for a boss
Only a boss
Anything less she telling them to get lost

The best thing about tonight's that we're not fighting
Could it be that we have been this way before
I know you don't think that I am trying
I know you're wearing thin down to the core
But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find
This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
You always thought that I was stronger
I may have failed
But I have loved you from the start
Oh
But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
It's impossible
So breathe in so deep
Breathe me in
I'm yours to keep
And hold onto your words
'Cause talk is cheap
And remember me tonight
When you're asleep
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day
I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don't make me change my mind
I won't live to see another day

Fighting with the shadows in your head
Living out the same old moment
Knowing you'd be better off instead,
If you could only . . .
Say what you need to say [8x]
Have no fear for giving in
Have no fear for giving over
You'd better know that in the end
It's better to say too much
Than never to say what you need to say again

And your faith is broken
Even as the eyes are closing
Do it with a heart wide open (a wide heart)

One step at a time
You believe and you doubt
You're confused, you got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours, should be yours, would be yours

Is one step at a time
One step at a time

Then have no fear, the camera is here

And they wanna know, oh oh oh (the return)
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah[Lupe Fiasco:]
Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu
Trying to catch his microphone, check 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me, standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me, I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung ""Blue""
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two tons too[Matthew Santos:]
If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera is here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh, yeah[Lupe Fiasco:]
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down to the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
Then out through China, nearly miss the airliners
Magnified times five, unless it's pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gonna clap and they ain't gonna praise
They want everything back that they've paid
Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim[Matthew Santos:]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah[Lupe Fiasco:]
So chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha ha ha-ha-ha
Ha ha ha-ha-ha, ha""[Matthew Santos:]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah
If you are, what you say you are
Then have no fear

64,Suffocate,J. Holiday,2008,J. Holiday,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jholiday/suffocate.html,"

Now even though I try to play it off
I'm thinking about you all day long
And I can't wait for shorty to come through
From your lips and back up to your eyes
My hands on your hips when we grind
I'm fantasizing bout what I'm gonna do to you
Got me fiening for her love can't lie
Man you should see how she got me
Spending all this time with her
And I couldn't leave her if I wanted to
Her love turns men into fools
Tell me what a man is to do
Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touching me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm going outta my mind
I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touching me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm going outta my mind
Whenever we up in this bed
And my fingers fall in your hair
I wonder if you feel me watching you
Cause I can't go a night without your loving
Got me looking at this phone
Every time it rings I hope it's you girl
You got my bracing for your love
And I fallen for you I can't lie
I just wanna be with you
Yes she got me there I said
And somebody call the paramedics
Tell em to hurry up and come through
Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me (can't breathe)
I can't breathe when you're touching me (when you touch me)
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm going outta my mind (I'm going outta my mind)
I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touching me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm going outta my mind
Don't ever leave me girl
I need you inside my world
I can't go a day without you
And see nobody else will ever do
I'll never feel like I feel with you
Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touching me (when you touch me)
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm going outta my mind (I'm going outta my mind)
I can't breathe when you talk to me (oh when you talk to me)
I can't breathe when you're touching me (I can't breathe when you touching me)
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm going outta my mind (I'm going outta my mind)
Oh no no I can't breathe
Oh no no I can't breathe (I can't breathe)
Oh no no I can't breathe oh no

I see your dirty face
Hide behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well, you made your bet
I made mine
Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock[Kevin Rudolph]
Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine
Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock[Lil Wayne]
Yeah!
Wayne's World
Planet Rock
Panties drop
And the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock)
And Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock)
And Amanda (rock)
And Tamara (rock)
Ménage à moi
I'm in here like, ""Bitch, what's up?""
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up
I can dick you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big-ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground
Weezy
Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Just let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock[Lil Wayne]
I'm back like I forgot something
I'm something
Ruling rock rubbin' rap runnin'
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll bang ya
Period, like the reminder[Kevin Rudolph]
I wish I could be
As cruel as you
And I wish I could say
The things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No, not this time

Doing a buck in the latest drop
I got stopped by a lady cop
She got me thinking I can date a cop
'Cause her uniform fit her so tight
She read me my rights
She put me in the car, she cut off her lights
She said I had the right to remain silent
Now I got her hollering sounding like a siren
Talkin' 'bout
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
Wee ooh wee ooh wee
And I know she the law, and she know I'm the boss
And she know I get high above the law
And she know I'm raw, she know I'm from the street
And all she want me to do is fuck the police
Talkin' about

But I'll do the time but her love is timeless

Tell your lieutenant get them cuffs off of you
I'm Kidd Kidd, my face on every wanted poster
I'm wanted by every lady cop all over
That ass so big I catch a battery to hold you
hands so big you thought I told you to pull it over
She pulled me over, pulled me out the rover
Then she pulled me closer, threw me in the back of the car
Put me in handcuffs start ripping my pants off

92,7 Things,Miley Cyrus,2008,Miley Cyrus,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mileycyrus/7things.html,"

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we've shared
It was awesome
But we lost it
It's not possible
For me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change
Until you hear
My dear
The 7 things I hate about you
The 7 things I hate about you (oh you)
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks
When you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
It's awkward and silent
As I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now
Is your sincere apology
When you mean it
I'll believe it
If you text it
I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh I'm not coming back
You're taking 7 steps here
The 7 things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends they're jerks
When you act like them
Just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The 7 that I like
The 7 things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined
Everything's alright
I want to be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you
You do

93,You're Gonna Miss This,Trace Adkins,2008,Trace Adkins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/traceadkins/youregonnamissthis.html,"

She was staring out that window, of that SUV
Complaining, saying I can't wait to turn 18
She said I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mamma put the car in park out there in front of the school
Then she kissed her head and said I was just like you[Chorus]
You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These Are Some Good Times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now 
But you're gonna miss this
Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In a one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her It's a nice place
She says It'll do for now
Starts talking about babies and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head and says Baby, just slow down[Chorus]
You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These Are Some Good Times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now 
But you're gonna miss this
Five years later there's a plumber workin' on the water heater
Dog's barkin', phone's ringin'
One kid's cryin', one kid's screamin'
She keeps apologizin'
He says They don't bother me. 
I've got 2 babies of my own. 
One's 36, one's 23.
Huh, it's hard to believe, but ...[Chorus]
You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These Are Some Good Times
So take a good look around 
You may not know it now 
But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna miss this
Yeah, you're gonna miss this

A thousand times I’ve seen you standing
Gravity like a lunar landing
Make me want to run till I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you’re all I hear
Everything we know fades to black
Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
I never thought that I had anymore to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same
Find the place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city buzz, sounds just like a fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seems to blur, they’re all the same
Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
I never thought that I had anymore to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same
So much more to say
So much to be done
Don’t you trick me out
We shall overcome
So all have stayed in place
We should have had the sun
Could have been inside
Instead we’re over here
Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time, too long defending
You and I are done pretending
I never thought that I had anymore to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
Everything will change
I, oh I, I 
wish this could last forever
I, oh I, I
As if we could last forever
Love remains the same
Love remains the same

You, you got me
Thinking it'll be alright.
You, you told me,
""Come and take a look inside.""
You believed me,
In every single lie.
But I, I failed you this time.
And it feels like tonight.
I can't believe I'm broken inside.
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do,
But try to make it up to you?
And it feels like tonight,
Tonight.
I was waiting
For the day you'd come around.
I was chasing,
And nothing was all I found.
From the moment you came into my life,
You showed me what's right.
And it feels like tonight.
I can't believe I'm broken inside.
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do,
But try to make it up to you?
And it feels like tonight.
I never felt like this before.
Just when I leave, I'm back for more.
Nothing else here seems to matter.
In these ever-changing days,
You're the one thing that remains.
I could stay like this forever.
And it feels like tonight.
I can't believe I'm broken inside.
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do,
But try to make it up to you?
And it feels like tonight.
Tonight.
Tonight.
'Cause there's nothing that I wanna do,
But try to make it up to you.

Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell,
It was love from above, that could save me from hell,
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see,
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me,
There were drums in the air as she started to dance,
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands,
And we sang...

You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces,
We were spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes,
No room left to move in between you and I,
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time,
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night,
And we sang...
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,

Sent from heaven.
Sent from heaven.
Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been.
You may have got your heart broken
A few times in the past
Never last strong as it used to,
Don't feel as good as it used to (before)
And all the things you used to say,
Things you used to do, went right out the door
Oh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
And you can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love[CHORUS:]
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
Now you can wait your whole life tryna change
What the fear from what it's been
You may have put your whole life into a man
Loving what you thought that could've been.
notice when you change
When you don't feel as good as you used to (before)
And everything you used to say,
Everything you used to do clear right out the door
Oh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
And it can't help who it loves
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love[CHORUS]
Everybody say
I wanna be the one you love
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
Everybody say I wanna be the one you trust
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
Everybody say I wanna be the one you need
I wanna be (sent from heaven)
Everybody say I wanna be the one who sent from heaven[CHORUS:]
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)

Red One
Konvict
Gaga (oh, yeah)
I've had a little bit too much, much
All of the people start to rush.
Start to rush by.
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find my drink or man.
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone.
What's going on, on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore.
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright.[Chorus:]
Just dance. Gonna be okay.
Da-doo-doo-doo
Just dance. Spin that record babe.
Da-doo-doo-doo
Just dance. Gonna be okay.
Duh-duh-duh-duh
Dance. Dance. Dance. Just dance.
Wish I could shut my playboy mouth.
How'd I turn my shirt inside out, inside out right?
Control your poison, babe
""Roses have thorns,"" they say.
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight.
What's going on, on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore.
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright.[Chorus][Colby O'Donis]
When I come through on the dance floor checking out that catalogue.
Can't believe my eyes so many women without a flaw.
And I ain't gonna' give it up, steady tryna pick it up like a car
I'ma hit it, I'ma hit it and latch onto it until tomorrow, yeah
Shorty I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirling up them hips 'round and 'round
And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the mean time stay, let me watch you break it down.[Chorus]
Half psychotic, sick hypnotic got my blueprint it's symphonic.
Half psychotic, sick hypnotic got my blueprint electronic.
Half psychotic, sick hypnotic got my blueprint it's symphonic.
Half psychotic, sick hypnotic got my blueprint electronic.
Go. Use your muscle, carve it out, work it, hustle
I got it, just stay close enough to get it
Don't slow! Drive it, clean it, Lysol, bleed it
Spend the last dough
(I got it)
In your pocko

We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there 
On a balcony in summer air.
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns,
See you make your way through the crowd,
And say, ""Hello.""
Little did I know...
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet.""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go.""
And I said,
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.""
So, I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So, close your eyes,
Escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh.
'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter.
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet.""
But you were everything to me.
I was begging you, ""Please don't go!""
And I said,
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.
Romeo, save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.""
Oh, oh, oh.
I got tired of waiting,
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading,
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
And I said,
""Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you, but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said,
""Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress.
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.""
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

Hey, walk out the house with my swagger
Hop in there we go, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, out of control
Just like my mind where I'm going
No women, no shorties, no nothing but clothes
No stopping now, my Pirrellis on roll
I like my jewelry, that's always on gold!
I know the storm is coming
My pockets keep telling me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies that's home
Then pop in the night 'cause it's meant to be ours
We keep a fadeaway shot
'Cause we balling this platinum Patron every hour
Look momma I owe you just like the flowers
Girl you the truth with all that goody power 'cause[Flo Rida:]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down[Ke$ha:]

From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down down
From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwing my money around
Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down down
Hey! Shorty must know I'm the man
My money love her like a number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my fans,
My Benjamin Franklins
A couple of grands,
I got rubber bands,
My paper planes making her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand
She's amazin',
Her fire blazin',
Hotter than Cajun,
Girl won't you move a little closer
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage,
That body belong on a poster
I'm in a daze,
That bottom is waving
At me like, ""Dammit I know ya.""
You want a show like a gun out a holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be ya chauffeur 'cause[Flo Rida:]

Ain't nothing more beautiful to be found
It's going down down[Bridge:]
I'm spending my money
I'm out of control
Somebody help me
She taking my bank roll
But I'm king of the club
And I'm wearing the crown
Poppin' these bottles
Touching these models
Watching they asses go down down[Flo Rida:]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down[Ke$ha:]

7,I'm Yours,Jason Mraz,2009,Jason Mraz,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonmraz/imyours.html,"

Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon, it's again my turn
To win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait
I'm yours
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
And look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
So I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait
I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate
I'm yours
But don't you want to come on and scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait
I'm yours
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't, please don't, please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh, this oh, this is our fate
I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, oh
Baby, do believe I'm yours?
You best believe, you best believe, I'm yours

You decided to dip but now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause I cried my tears
For three good years
Ya can't be mad at me
'Cause if you like it then you should have put a ring on it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Hold me tighter than my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I can't care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn
And now you gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me

Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost I'll be gone

How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know

Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me
In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies

I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night
In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road

How could you be so heartless? (How, how?)

I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
Now where's your picket fence love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?
And truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I'm lying
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself
Where'd it all go wrong?
But the list goes on and on
And truth be told I miss you
And truth be told I'm lying
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
Now you'll never see
What you've done to me
You can take back your memories
They're no good to me
And here's all your lies
You can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look
That you wear so well
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
When you see my face
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way
Hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you hear this song and you sing along but you'll never tell
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well
Hope it gives you hell
When you hear this song
I hope that it will give you hell
You can sing along
I hope that it puts you through hell

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do.
But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me,
You belong with me.
Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
""Hey, isn't this easy?""
And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down.
You say you're fine I know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels,
I wear sneakers.
She's cheer captain,
And I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you,
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.[Instrumental]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night.
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry.
I know your favorite songs,
And you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.
Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.
You belong with me.
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me.

You reply then shit get blown
Way outta proportion
Way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you'll get jumped, hell that's nothing
They don't wanna stop there now they bussin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin'
You to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit 4 times
Plus it hit ya spine
Paralyzed waist down now ya wheel chair bound
Nevermind that now you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you fussin' with 3 guys
Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday
All over bull shit, dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be 'cos of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blo I guess
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away[Chorus (Justin Timberlake (T.I.))][Verse 2 - T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragedy
Situation could've been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin', and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing ya know we cappin'
Get locked up then didn't even get mad
Now think about damn what a life I had
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit still look back get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight
I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job
Cost me more
I'd took that ass-whooping now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk shit all night
'Cos I hit you, you sue me,
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away[Chorus (Justin Timberlake (T.I.))][Hook - Justin Timberlake]
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
That old me is dead and gone
But that new me will be alright
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
That old me is dead and gone
But that new me will be alright[Chorus (Justin Timberlake (T.I.))]

13,You Found Me,The Fray,2009,The Fray,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fray/youfoundme.html,"

[Verse 1]
I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything.""[Verse 2]
Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad[Chorus:]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me[Verse 3]
In the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me[Chorus:]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me[Bridge]
Early morning
The city breaks
I've been callin'
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never send me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want[Chorus 3 and outro]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
Why'd you have to wait?
To find me, to find me

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me, somebody
I'm ready now [x7]
Someone like you, somebody [x3]
I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see

[Rihanna:]
You're gonna be a shining star with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.
'Cause everyone knows just who you are-are.
So live your life, ay, ay, ay.
You steady chasing that paper.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
Ain't got no time for no haters.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
No telling where it'll take you.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
'Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)[T.I.:]
Never mind what haters say,
Ignore them 'til they fade away.
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away.
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today.
You still be wasting days away, nah had I never saved the day.
Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay.
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way.
I never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way.
Some say they sold the yay and no they couldn't even work on Labor Day.
It ain't that black and white, it has an area that's shaded grey.
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away.
Some move away to make a way not move away 'cause they afraid.
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away.
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt their face away.
Like I once made them spray, now I could make them plead their case away.
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break.
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away.[Rihanna:]
You're gonna be a shining star, with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.
'Cause everyone knows, who you are-are.
So live your life, ay, ay, ay.
You steady chasing that paper.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
No telling where it'll take you.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
'Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life.[T.I.:]
I'm the opposite of moderate,
Immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid.
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics.
Articulate but still would grab a nigga by the collar quick.
Whoever having problems with their record sales just holla tip.
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow tip.
I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it.
Could do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy.
The hootin' and the hollerin' back and forth with the arguing.
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in.
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'.
The cheques into your bank account and you up out of poverty.
Your values is a disarray, prioritizing horribly.
Unhappy with the riches 'cause your piss poor morally.
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning.
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden aren't we?[Rihanna:]
You're gonna be a shining star, with fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far.
'Cause everyone knows, who you are-are.
So live your life, ay, ay, ay.
You steady chasing that paper.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
No telling where it'll take you.
Just live your life, oh, ay, ay, ay.
'Cause I'm a paper chaser.
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh)
Now everybody watchin' what I do.
Come walk in my shoes,
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to.
I got my mind on my money and I not goin' away.
So keep on gettin' your paper and keep on climbin'.
Look in the mirror and keep on shinin'.
'Til the game ends, 'til the clock stops.
We gonna post up on the top spot.
So live your life.

Tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show
I wanna see how you lose control
So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape
So, baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby, are you down?
Down, down

So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape

Down like she's suppose to be
She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature
'Cause to me she's zero degree
She's cold, over-freeze
I got that girl from overseas
Now she's my Miss America
Now can I be her soldier, please?
I'm fighting for this girl
On the battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby Cupid
Sending arrows from above?
Don't you ever leave the side of me
And definitely, not probably
And honestly
I'm down like the economy
Baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry

Down, down

Every move I make feels lost with no direction

But I, I gotta keep tryin'
Gotta keep my head held high
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side
It's the climb
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down
But no, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments
That I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep goin'
And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on
'Cause
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle

Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side

Always gonna be an uphill battle
Somebody's gonna have to lose

Keep climbin'

But on another note let's have sex in my dorm
And I'm a' make you beg cause you look pretty when you begging

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out!
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't begin to pull me back to the ground again
And it's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out!
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo...
Halo, ooh ooh...
Halo, ooh ooh...
Halo, ooh ooh, oh...
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo

You change your mind like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch I would know
And you over-think always speak cryptically
I should know that you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go
You're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
We used to be just like twins so in sync
The same energy now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing, now you're plain boring
I should know that you're not gonna change
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go
You're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go
You're hot then you're cold
You're ""Yes"" then you're ""No""

My eyes are open wide
By the way
I made it through the day
I watched the world outside
By the way
I'm leaving out today
I just saw Halley's comet
She waved
Said, ""Why you always running in place?""
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere
Tell my mother
Tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize
This is my life
I hope they understand
I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance
Please don't cry one tear for me
I'm not afraid
Of what I have to say
This is my one and only voice
So listen close
It's only for today
I just saw Halley's comet
She waved
Said, ""Why you always running in place?""
Even the man in the moon disappeared
Somewhere in the stratosphere
Tell my mother
Tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize
This is my life
I hope they understand
I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance
Here's my chance
This is my chance
Tell my mother
Tell my father
I've done the best I can
To make them realize
This is my life
I hope they understand
I'm not angry, I'm just saying
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance
Sometimes goodbye is a second chance

There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe
Well baby I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first
I'm like the ringleader
I call the shots
(call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker
I make it hot
When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline moving through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same
All the eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gonna trip
Just like a circus
Don't stand there watching me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
Just like a circus
There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me, and ones that are scared
So baby I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like a ring leader

[Kid Cudi:]
Day and night.
What, what?
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind.
What, what?
I look for peace but see I don't attain.
What, what?
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play.
Now look at this—what, what?—madness.
The magnet keeps attracting me, me.
What, what?
I try to run but see I'm not that fast.
What, what?
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last.[Chorus:]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night[Video version:] The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night.
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night[Video version:] The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change, never change.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night[Kid Cudi:]
Hold the phone.
What, what?
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo.
What, what?
He's on the move can't seem to shake the shade.
What, what?
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made.
The pain is deep.
What, what?
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep.
What, what?
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too.
What, what?
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through[Chorus][Kid Cudi:]
Slow mo.
What, what?
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new.
What, what?
He seems alive though he is feeling blue.
What, what?
The sun is shining. Man, he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights.
What, what?
They fade away he slips into his white Nikes.
What, what?
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way.
What, what?
To free his mind in search of—
To free his mind in search of—
To free his mind in search of—[Chorus]

My tummys turnin and I'm feelin kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous,

So hard with my girls not around me
Its definitely not a Nashville party
Cause' all I see are stilletos
I guess I never got the memo
My tummys turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the D.J. dropped my favorite tune
and a Britney song was on

If you boys really real enough
This is La Familia
I'll explain later

What you think I rap for
To push a fucking Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I could spend my whole life good-will-hunting
Only good gon' come is as good when I'm cumming

Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?

I see your dirty face
Hide behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well, you made your bet
I made mine
Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock[Kevin Rudolph]
Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine
Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock[Lil Wayne]
Yeah!
Wayne's World
Planet Rock
Panties drop
And the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock)
And Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock)
And Amanda (rock)
And Tamara (rock)
Ménage à moi
I'm in here like, ""Bitch, what's up?""
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up
I can dick you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big-ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground
Weezy
Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Just let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock[Lil Wayne]
I'm back like I forgot something
I'm something
Ruling rock rubbin' rap runnin'
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll bang ya
Period, like the reminder[Kevin Rudolph]
I wish I could be
As cruel as you
And I wish I could say
The things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie

Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans le love game?
I'm on a mission,
And it involves some heavy touchin' yeah.
You've indicated your interest,
I'm educated in sex, yes.
And now I want it bad,
Want it bad.
A love game,
A love game.
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun,
This beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick[2x]
Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans le love game?
I can see you staring there from across the block with a smile on your mouth and your hand on your huh
The story of us it always starts the same with a boy and a girl and a huh and a game!
And a game
And a game
And a game
A love game![4x]
Let's play a love game,
Play a love game
Do you want love or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans le love game?
Dans le love game?

You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause you're hung-over and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID but you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin' dirty looks
Now don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the hell out of town
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Why are these lights so bright?
Did we get hitched last night
Dressed up like Elvis? Why am I wearing your class ring?
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
You got me into this
Information overload
Situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S
Ha,and get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me, told me, told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes, now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
That's what you get, baby
Shake the glitter
Shake, shake, shake the glitter!
Give me some cash out, baby
Give me some cash out, baby

Aye, Jill, you know the old sugar daddies?
They be tricking, they tell them girls
I said you can have whatever you like
I said you can have whatever you like
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
Baby, you can have whatever you like
I said you can have whatever you like
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you can go wherever you like
I said you can go wherever you like
Anytime you want to pick up the telephone, you
Know it ain't nothing to drop a couple stacks on you
Want it, you can get it, my dear
Five million dollar home, drop Bentleys, I swear
I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you can have whatever you like
I said you can have whatever you like
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you can go wherever you like
I said you can go wherever you like
Shawty, you the hottest, love the way you drop it
Brain so good could've sworn you went to college.
Hundred K deposit, vacations in the tropics
Everybody know it ain't tricking if you got it
And you ain't never ever gotta go in your wallet.
Long as I got rubber-band banks in my pocket
Five, six rides with rims and a body kit
You ain't gotta downgrade, you can get what I get
My chick can have what she want
And go in any store buy any bag she want
I know you ain't ever had a man like that
To buy you anything your heart desire like that
I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you can have whatever you like
I said you can have whatever you like
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you can go wherever you like
I said you can go wherever you like
I'm talking big boy rides, and big boy ice
Let me put this big boy in your life
That thing get so wet and hit so right
Let me put this big boy in your life; that's right
I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night

Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows

I see it every day
Everywhere I look they say
Another life has been taken away
It makes my stomach turn
But livin' here you gotta learn
Get used to it, it's reality
Say your prayers
Hope it won't happen to you
Mind you business
Do what you gotta do
Don't look for trouble
Sometimes trouble finds you
What can you do, what can I do?
One on one fights don't exist
Fist fights are extinct
Nowadays people don't seem to think
They can't see how easy
It is to set a soul free
That decision is not theirs to make[Repeat chorus]
Now you see what I mean
Protecting my family and me
What can I do?
It makes my stomach turn
But livin' here you gotta learn
You gotta fight back when someones
Tries to take your life from you

And that haunted me, all the way home

Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-no!""
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racin' time, where's the finish line?
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin', keep the loving goin'
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby, I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
Okay, let's go!
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my!""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuana, do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, ""Move,"" a bitch move
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

48,If I Were A Boy,Beyonce,2009,Beyoncé,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beyonceknowles/ifiwereaboy.html,"

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home (to come home)
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (granted)
And everything you had got destroyed
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah, you don't understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy

We're driving slow through the snow
On fifth avenue
And right now radio is
All that we can hear
Man we ain't talked since we left
It's so overdue
It's cold outside
But between us
It's worse in here
The world slows down but my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part where the end starts
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't want to try now
All that's left is goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here
Everyday seven takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now 'fore we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me
The world slows down but my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part where the end starts
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't want to try now
All that's left is goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here
I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothing is wrong
But there is no more time for lies
Cause I see sun set in your eyes
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't want to try now
All that's left is goodbye to
Find a way that I can tell you
But I gotta do this
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I hate this part
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take these tears
I hate this part right here

This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to do it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right, it's just like déja vu
Me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end?
Is it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to do it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
You can't give up, (when you're looking for) a diamond in the rough
(cause you never know)
When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on)
Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh
Nobody wants to do it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing,
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St. Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh [5x]
Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

It's like a battlefield
One word turns into a war
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down
My world's nothing when you're gone
I'm out here without a shield
Can't go back now
Both hands tied behind my back for nothing, oh, no
These times when we climb so fast to fall again
Why we gotta fall for it now
I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like ...
a battlefield (battlefield)
a battlefield (battlefield)

Can't swallow our pride,
Neither of us wanna raise that flag
If we can't surrender

Talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
And she move like a boss
Do what a boss do
She got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kind of girl I need
She got her own thing

Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing

Ooh there's something about
The kind of woman that can do for herself
I look at her and it makes me proud
There's something about her
Something oh so sexy about
The kind of woman that don't even need my help
She said she got it she got it no doubt,
There's something about her
'Cause she work like a boss
Play like a boss
Car and a crib she 'bout to pay 'em both off
And the bills are paid on time
She made for a boss
Only a boss
Anything less she telling them to get lost

Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Ooh the way you shine
Miss Independent
Her favorite thing to say: ""Don't worry. I got it.""
And everything she got best believe she bought it
She gon' steal my heart ain't no doubt about it
Girl, you're everything I need,
Said you're everything I need
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Won't you come and spend a little time
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Ooh the way you shine
Miss Independent
Miss Independent
That's why I love her

60,Fireflies,Owl City,2009,Owl City,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/owlcity/fireflies.html,"

You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude
But I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
(Thread, thread...)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
(Ha-ha)
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(Jar, jar, jar...)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams

61,New Divide,Linkin Park,2009,Linkin Park,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/linkinpark/newdivide.html,"

I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide
In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you'd deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
Across this new divide
Across this new divide

[Jay-Z:]
Yeah I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State St
Catch me in the kitchen like the Simmons' whipping Pastry
Cruisin' down 8th St., off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to TyTy, still sippin' Mai Tai's
Sittin' courtside, Knicks & Nets give me high five
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from[Alicia Keys:]
In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York
New York
You're welcome OG. I made you hot, nigga[Jay-Z:]
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
8 million stories, out there in the naked
City it's a pity, half of y'all won't make it
Me, I got a plug Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three-dice Cee-lo, three-card Monte
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire State that's[Alicia Keys:]
In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York
New York
That boy good. Welcome to the bright light, baby[Jay-Z:]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
Or they could step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
Lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
And it the winter gets cold, in Vogue with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien[Alicia Keys:]
In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York
New York[Alicia Keys:]
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say ""yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"" (c'mon, c'mon)
I'm from[Alicia Keys:]
In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you

(And I hope.. and I hope..)
I've practiced this for hours, gone round and round
And now I think that I've got it all down
And as I say it louder, I love how it sounds
'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out
Not wrappin' this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why
It's no surprise. I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise
It came out like a river, once I let it out
When I thought that I wouldn't know how
Held onto it forever, just pushing it down
It felt so good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why
It's no surprise. I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul left to save
Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise
Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The lovin' look that's left your eyes
That's why this comes as no, as no surprise
If I could see the future and how this plays out
I bet it's better than where we are now
But after going through this
It's easier to see the reason why
It's no surprise.. I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today (stayed 'til today)
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise
The kiss goodnight, it comes with me
Both wrong and right, our memories (our memories)
The whispering before we sleep,
Just one more thing that you can't keep (you can't keep)
Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The lovin' look that's left your eyes
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise
(And I hope, and I hope, and I hope, and I hope, and I hope.)

64,She Wolf,Shakira,2009,Shakira,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shakira/shewolf.html,"

S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out
A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry
I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office, ah
So I'm gonna go somewhere cosy to get me a lover and tell you about it
There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe
Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student
To locate the single man I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hot line in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys I just want to enjoy
By having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy
There's a she wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe
S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out
S.O.S. she's in disguise
S.O.S. she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out
There's a she wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

I love you but I don't think
I can love you anymore...
When I kiss you so good,
Why would you wanna break up?
When this loving is so good,
Why would you wanna break up?
When I hit that so good,
Why would you wanna break up?
When this feeling is so good,
Why would you wanna break up?
Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm
Loving you, loving you

Do anything for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See I been driving through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?[Gucci Mane]
Now baby girl have dumped me
She no longer wants me
I'm no longer hired
She says that I've been fired
On to the next one
More fish in the sea
Girls are like buses
Miss one, Next 15 one comin'
Gucci Mane crazy and his ice game stunnin'
Swag so stupid still the bitch straight dumped me
Over, no more smokin' doja
Baby girl went AWOL
She used to be my soulja
(Don't) Don't I lace you with the Gucci
(Don't) Don't I deck you in the Louis
(Don't) don't I make your earlobes freeze
(Don't) don't when I dive I dive deep ?
I know I be, gone
I know I be, gone
I know I be, (flirting with them girls)
I know I be, said I'd be right back, but take to long.
I know I be, saying I be faithful but I don't
I know I be,
Making you them promises
Then breaking you're heart again
Telling you she wasn't, who she was
Then we arguing, but baby (I love you)
Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm
Loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up?
Do anything for you

You might be from the hood
But to me girl you're a model,
Everything that I-I-I ever seen in a model,
If you're leaving baby, don't leave me till tomorrow
Tonight we gon' get a little tipsy, with a bottle.
You gonna get me up'
I'm take 'em down
I'm gonna change my ways
We gon' work it out
Girl I wouldn't be the same if you was with somebody else
Girl it wouldn't be the same if I was with somebody else
I know I made mistakes before,
Promise you won't get hurt no more,
I got what you like and you know
Once you lay down, It's on.

Turn the lights on!
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes
I'm going outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on!)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air
('Cause you're my, you're my...)
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real and tell me you'll stay by my side
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on!)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air
('Cause you're my, you're my....)
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death can make us part
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on!)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air
('Cause you're my, you're my...)
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

70,If Today Was Your Last Day,Nickelback,2009,Nickelback,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickelback/iftodaywasyourlastday.html,"

My best friend gave me the best advice
He said, ""Each day's a gift and not a given right.
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by.
That first step you take is the longest stride.""
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say ""goodbye"" to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you had?
If today was your last day
Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live it like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say ""goodbye"" to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you had?
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
And would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day
If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say ""goodbye"" to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you had?
(Would you? Would you?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
And would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

Top down in the summer sun
The day we met was like a hit-and-run
And I still taste it on my tongue
(taste it on my tongue)
The sky was burning up like fireworks
You made me want you oh so bad it hurt
But, girl, in case you haven't heard
I used to be love-drunk, but now I'm hung-over
Love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night
Now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me crying
Say hello to goodbye
'Cause just one sip
Would make me sick
I used to be love-drunk, but now I'm hung-over
Love you forever, but now it's over
Hot sweat and blurry eyes
We're spinning round a roller-coaster ride
The world stuck in black and white
You drove me crazy every time we touched
Now I'm so broken that I can't get up
Oh, girl, you make me such a lush
I used to be love-drunk, but now I'm hung-over
Love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night
Now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me crying
Say hello to goodbye
'Cause just one sip
Would make me sick
I used to be love-drunk, but now I'm hung-over
I'll love you forever, but now it's over
All of the time I wasted on you
All of the bullshit you put me through
I'm checking into rehab
'Cause everything that we had
Didn't mean a thing to you
I used to be love-drunk, but now I'm hung-over
Love you forever, but now I'm sober
I used to be love-drunk, but now I'm hung-over
Love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night
Now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me crying
Say hello to goodbye
'Cause just one sip
Would make me sick
I used to be love-drunk, but now I'm hung-over
Love you forever, but now it's over
Now it's over
Still taste it on my tongue
Now it's over

73,I Love College,Asher Roth,2009,Asher Roth,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/asherroth/ilovecollege.html,"

[Talking:]
(Cause I ain't goin out like a sucker, no way
I'm nice right now, I, I feel good
If you have a drink, would you please put it in the air)
That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again, man I love college...
I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip banker's club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup
Lets get fucked up (lets get fucked UP!)
I'm next on the table,
Who want what? (What?!)
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it otherwise you naked
Time isn't wasted when you're getting wasted
Woke up today and all I could say is, um
That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man I love college (hey!)
And I love drinking
And I love women
Man I love college
I can't tell you what I learned from school
But (nah) I could tell you a story or two, um
Yeah of course I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on (get the sharpie!)
And don't leave the house till the booze gone
And don't have sex if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on (trust me)
And tomorrow night, find a new joint
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted when you're getting wasted
Woke up today and all I can say is
That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man I love college
And I love drinking
And I love women
I love college
Now, if everybody would please put their drink
As high as they can, as high as they can
And repeat after me:
Chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug
Freshman freshman freshman freshman
Do something crazy! Do something crazy! Do something crazy! Do something crazy!
Keg stand Keg stand Keg stand Keg stand
That party last night
(Man I love college, love it, I love it!)
That party last night
Alright everybody, I gotta head back to class for a little bit
That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it (you know its going down)
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed (you're all invited)
But my good friends is all I need (bring your friends)
Pass out at three wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man I love college
I love college, do I really have to graduate or can I just stay here for the rest of my life?

Oh baby baby
Have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom
Is she smokin' up outside
Oh baby baby
Does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I'mma buy her
Do you know just what she likes
Tell me have you seen her
'Cause I'm so
I can't get her off of my brain

But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
Love me hate me
But can't you see what I see
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
Amy told me that she's gonna meet me up
I don't know where or when and now they're closing up the club
I've seen her once or twice before she knows my face
But it's hard to see with all the people standing in the way
Tell me have you seen her

'Cause I've been waiting here forever
Let me know if she was going out tonight

She had a shiny little beamer with the rag top down
Sitting in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barking and a wagging around
I just laughed and said ya'll get in
She had on a new dress and she curled her hair
She was looking too good not to go somewhere
I said what you wanna do baby I don't care
We can go to the show or we can stay right here and
I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
I said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fire flies are dancing and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house or
We can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
Mmmmm just let me dust off the seat
Mmmmm now put your pretty little arms around me
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you've got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go to town
Or we can go another round
On my big green tractor

76,White Horse,Taylor Swift,2009,Taylor Swift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/whitehorse.html,"

Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl
I should have known, I should have known
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
Maybe I was naïve
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around
And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now

Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide
Did someone break your heart inside
You're in ruins
One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I...
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins
One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I...
Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home
Did you stand too close to the fire?
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone
When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins
One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight

You know I like my chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
It's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive
Or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign
On a peace of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree
Have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly
Let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love
Get a little chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustler, of a hustler, of a, of a hustler...
Na-na-na, diva is a female version of a hustler, of a hustler, of a, of a hustler...
Since 15 in my stilettos, been strutting in this game,
""What's yo age?"" was the question they asked when I hit the stage
I'm a diva, best believe her, you see how she getting paid?
She ain't calling him to grade-up, don't need him, her best maid
This is a stick-up, stick-up (I need them bags, all that money.)
We're gonna stick-up, stick-up (You see them ask, ""Where that money?"")
All my ladies get it up, I see you, I do the same;
Take it to another level, no passengers on my plane.
I'm a, a diva, hey, I'm a, I'm a, a diva, hey

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday

Remember the first time we met
You was at the mall with your friend
I was scared to approach ya
But then you came closer
Hopin' you would give me a chance
Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
She like a song played again and again
That girl, like something off a poster
That girl is a dime they say
That girl is a gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day
Shawty's like a melody in my head

See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night 'til the morn
Girl, you really change my life
Doing things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cooking things she likes
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife
That girl, like something off a poster
That girl is a dime they say
That girl is the gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day, ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head

I can be your melody
Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me
Ay, I can be your melody
Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me
Ay, na na na na na na na

84,Then,Brad Paisley,2009,Brad Paisley,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bradpaisley/then.html,"

I remember trying not to stare
The night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later
In the front porch light
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
But I thought I loved you then
And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it's ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then
I remember taking you back
To right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again
I thought I loved you then
But now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it's ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then
I can just see you
With a baby on the way
I can just see you
When your hair is turning grey
What I can't see
Is how I'm ever gonna love you more
But I've said that before
And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
We'll look back someday
At this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then
And I thought I loved you then

85,Her Diamonds,Rob Thomas,2009,Rob Thomas,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/robthomas/herdiamonds.html,"

Oh what the hell she said
I just can't win for losing
And she lays back down
Man there's so many times
I don't know what I'm doing
Like I don't know now
By the light of the moon
She rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night
Can make you blind
I can just imagine
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then i do too
So I let her be
And she says oh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win it
Hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
She sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night
And i know i could break her concentration
But it don't feel right
By the light of the moon
She rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too
And don't let her see
And she says oh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win it
Hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
She shuts out the night
Tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
She'll be alright
She'll be alright
Just not tonight
And she says oh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win it
Hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh[Chorus:]
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I've been missing you crazy
How do you how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
Tried my best at movin' on
Have yet to find a girl like you
See things now I didn't before
Now wishin' I had more time with you
How do you stay awake
Knowin' all I do is think of you
All the things we thought about
Then, never will happen again
If I could just see you[Pre-Chorus:]
If I had my way i'd come and get you girl
In your favourite car with the missing top
Around my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart[Chorus x2]
Baby all that I hear from my friends
Again again and again come and ask 'bout you
They say, ""We saw your girl at the game
And damn we gotta say a big mistake by you""
Not only does your body bang
But I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you're gettin' more sleep
Can't think can't eat till I come see you[Pre-Chorus][Chorus]
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh[Chorus x2]

One, two
One, one, one, one, two, three
Countin' one, two
Countin' one, one, two, three
Babe, pick a night
To come out and play
If it's alright
What do you say?
Merrier the more
Triple fun that way
Twister on the floor
What do you say?
Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing
Are you in?
I am counting
One, two, three

Make 'em say my name
Loving the extreme

Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing

What we do is innocent
Just for fun and nothing meant
If you don't like the company
Let's just do it you and me
You and me
Or three
Or four on the floor
One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got 180 degrees and I'm caught in between
Countin' one, two, three

Getting down with 3P, everybody loves

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they're gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too late
I run my life
Or is it running me
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow it seems
When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster
So, I run to you
I run to you, baby
When it all starts coming undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you
We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slippin' right on through
And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster
So, I run to you
I run to you, baby
When it all starts coming undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you
Oh, I run to you
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster
So, I run to you
I run to you, baby

Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

Oh sweetheart, put the bottle down
You got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you found it
Slow motion sparks, you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys
Oh yes, they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills, then get cold feet
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight
I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beats
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last, but this is now
So love the one you're with
You want a chase, but you're chasing your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say...
'Cause I feel the distance
Between us
Could be over with a snap of your finger
Oh, no
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh no, I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight to say
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight to say goodnight
Oh sweetheart, put the bottle down

You did it! Let's hop a cab, and split it

93,People Are Crazy,Billy Currington,2009,Billy Currington,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billycurrington/peoplearecrazy.html,"

This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers
And swapping I-don't-cares
Talking politics
Blonde and red-haired chicks
Old dogs and new tricks
And habits we ain't kicked
We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say
""God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy""
He said, ""I fought two wars
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said, ""Damned if I know""
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys'll do
We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
He said, ""These damn things'll kill me yet""
""But God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy""
Last call is 2 AM
I said goodbye to him
I never talk to him again
Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well
And I dropped by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said
""God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy""
God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy
God is great, beer is good
And people are crazy

94,Whatever It Is,Zac Brown Band,2009,Zac Brown Band,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/zacbrownband/whateveritis.html,"

She got eyes that cut you like a
Knife and lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
And when she walks in a room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees
She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is
You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people ask me why it is
Tell them I don't know
There's just something 'bout the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife
She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is
'Cause when she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
'Cause when she loves me
I'm on top of the world
'Cause when she loves me
No, I can live forever
And when she loves me
I am untouchable
She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
'Cause every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you"" (I do)
You got whatever it is
Oh, you got whatever it is

Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would have worked out right
We were never meant for ""do or die""
I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you now
I can't stop
I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone
Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
Started with the perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
""Perfect"" couldn't keep this love alive
You know that I love you so
I love you enough to let you go
I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right
When you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on
So I'm already gone
Ah, already gone, already gone, already gone
Ah, already gone, already gone, already gone
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right
When you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on
So I'm already gone

[Verse 1:]
Am I suppose to put my life on hold
Because you don't know how to act?
And you don't know where your life is going?
Am I suppose to be torn apart
Broken-hearted in a corner cryin'?
Pardon me if I don't show it[Bridge:]
I don't care if I never see you again
I'll be alright
Take this final piece of advice and get yourself together
But either way, baby, I'm gone[Chorus:]
I'm so over it, I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers and just in case you're wonderin'
I got that new I'm-a-single-girl swag
Got me with my girls and we're singin' it
Sing![Hook:]
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey, Goodbye [repeat][Verse 2:]
Cut my hair cause it reminded me of you
I know you like the long do
Had to switch up my attitude up
Thinkin' of changin' up how I ride
No more on the passenger side
Too bad you missed out on the way that I drive it[Bridge][Chorus]
H-hey, H-hey
H-hey, Goodbye[Chorus][Hook x2]
Goodbye!

Come down selector
This one goes out to you and yours, worldwide
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I've been a lot of places all around the way
I've seen a lot of joy and I've seen a lot of pain
But I don't wanna write a love song for the world
I just wanna write a song about a boy and a girl
Junkies on the corner always calling my name
OK
And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games
When I saw you getting down, well, I hope it was you
And when I look into your eyes I knew it was true
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
Now I'm not a highly metaphysical man
But I know when the stars are aligned you can
OK
Bump into a person in the middle of the road
Look into their eyes and you suddenly know
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
Rocking rocking
Dancing in the night in the middle of June
My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you
Sure
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
Alright
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
And I say, rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, close to you
Rocking in the dance hall, moving with you
I say, hey poppa, hey poppa, take off your shoes
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, close to you
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I say, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma, hey momma
What are gonna do, papa
My momma told me don't lose you
'Cause the best luck I had was you
And I know one thing
That I love you
I say hey, I'll be gone today
OK
But I'll be back all around the way
You promise
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
I say hey, I'll be gone today
But I'll be back all around the way
It seems like everywhere I go
The more I see, the less I know
But I know one thing
That I love you (baby girl)
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
Rocking in the dance hall moving with you
I love you, I love you, I love you
It's true, it's true
I love you, I love you, I love you

Ether boy!!!! Hey!!!![Chorus: Ron Browz]

We need more bottles tell ma hurry up
Tell 'em Ron Browz here hottest in America
Gimme sixteen bars and you know I tear it up
Know it's me when you see this fur in your area
And she call me all night cause you can get it up
On my neck on my wrist everything is litted up
Drinkin bottles of that Clique 'till I spit it up
Only get one life so you gotta live it up
(HEY!!!) If you in the things I'm in
Shorty we can be friends, shorty we can be friends
Right now, I wanna see you dance, see you dance

When I go to the dealer you know I cop that (What's that?)

Came through Harlem like the Rooftop back (AIYYO!!!)
Money in the bank man you know don't stop that (Stop that stop that stop that!!!)
(*OHHHHHHHH!!!!!) Now we tryin to get up in the club
(*OHHHHHHHH!!!!!) Try to tell me no cause I'm rollin with the thugs
(We got money bitch!!!) Until I flash a couple of dollars (Yep!)
Tell 'em we only want tables and we buyin out the bottles
(*OHHHHHHHH!!!!!) Y'all know the order
Tell 'em ten Rose's and a few cold waters (Right!!!)
Only Petron and a couple of lemons (Let's go)
Ten thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims (What else)
We standin on couches, a couple of women (Hey baby)
We was ballin hard it was just the ninth inning (Early)
He told shorty we could be friends (Yep)
And your friends could meet with my friends (What else)
And we could do this on the weekend or on the weekday
We could do this on the freeway and get in the freak way
SHIT!!! We could get in on three way (Oh)
Blackberry two way, souped up cars on the thruway (Yep)
We superstars no Lupe, we could do this like a duet
But y'all be the singers on the mic, wait let me dim the lights
This was in the car while I was stoppin at the light[Chorus: Ron Browz]
How we ball in the club I know you hate it
Mami dancin on the floor all like she naked

All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it

OHHHHHHHH!!!!! We pop champagne!
OHHHHHHHH!!!!! We pop champagne![Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Baby I wanna see you work (Go) See you dance (Go)
Without no shirt, without those pants
Pop champagne ain't a damn thing change
Spray it in the air make it champagne rain
Buckets of ice keep the champagne cool
Mami got a body see that damn thing move
It's no sex in the champagne room
Says who? Baby I'll break all rules
Bring it here and I'll break off you
She see me in V.I.P. and wanna break on through
When she with you she lyin but she fake it
When she with me she like it she never fake it[Bridge: Ron Browz]
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance
I wanna see you dance, see you dance

Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day there'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me
Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same[Hook:]
Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free
Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to live, I had to live
I had to leave, I had to leave[Chorus:]
If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, pretty wings around[Verse 2:]
I came wrong you were right
Transformed your love into light
Baby believe me I'm sorry I told you lies
I turned day into night
Sleep 'til I died a thousand times
I should've showed you
Better nights better times better days
I miss you more and more[Chorus:]
If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings around
So pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Your pretty wings, your pretty wings around
So pretty wings, oh, pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around[Repeat until end:]
Your pretty wings, pretty wings around

Some things we don't talk about
Rather do without
And just hold the smile
Falling in and out of love
Same damn problem
Together all the while
You can never say never
While we don't know when
But time and time again
Younger now than we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Picture, you're the queen of everything
As far as the eye can see
Under your command
I will be your guardian
When all is crumbling
I steady your hand
You can never say never
While we don't know when
Time, time, time again
Younger now than we were before
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
We're falling apart and coming together again and again
We're growing apart but we pull it together, pull it together, together again
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

Don't let me go

Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind?
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind?
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
Oh, whoa
Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now

Hey, hey, hey
Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you
Blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream
I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind
Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister
On the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss
A single thing you do tonight
Hey, hey, hey
Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind
Like me
You gave my life direction
A game-show love connection
We can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out of my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna
Blow your mind

A single thing you do tonight
Way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug
I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of
You see
I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be
With me

Where the grass is really greener

Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)

Tryna creep a little sneak peek (at us)

To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love

Sun-kissed skin
So hot
We'll melt your popsicle

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
A wish right now

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
A wish right now
A wish right now[B.o.B:]
Yeah, I could use a dream or a Genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're starin' at that phone in your lap
And you're hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night[Hayley Williams (B.o.B):]

Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryin' to get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we could make some wishes outta' airplanes
Then maybe oh maybe I'd go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur
What's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish
To end the politics
And get back to the music
That started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars)

7,Love The Way You Lie,Eminem Featuring Rihanna,2010,Eminem,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/lovethewayyoulie.html,"

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it
""Wait! Where you going?""
""I'm leaving you!""
""No you ain't. Come back""
We're running right back
Here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
""Who's that dude?""
""I don't even know his name""
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in them
It's the rage that took over
It controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
Next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back
It wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
I'm just gonna
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now listen to me, baby,
Before I love and leave you.
They call me heart breaker.
I don't wanna deceive you.
If you fall for me,
I'm not easy to please.
I might tear you apart.
Told you from the start.
Baby, from the start.
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart.
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart.
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart.
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart.
There's no point tryna hide it.
No point tryna evade it.
I know I got a problem.
Problem with misbehaving.
If you fall for me,
I'm not easy to please.
I might tear you apart.
Told you from the start.
Baby, from the start.
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart.
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart.
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart.
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart.
And I know karma's gonna get me back for being so cold.
Like a big bad wolf I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone.
If you fall for me I'm only gonna tear you apart.
Told ya from the start.
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart.
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart.
I'm only gonna break, break your, break, break your heart.

Beautiful girls, all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you, baby

They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
'Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah...)
Nothing on you, baby
(Nuh-nuh-nuh-nothing on you babe, nuh-nothing on you)[B.o.B:]
I know you feel where I'm coming from (from)
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done (done)
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun (the uh)
On the carousel, so around I spun (spun)
With no directions, just tryna get some (some)
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)
And so I lost more than I had ever won (What?)
And honestly, I ended up with none (Huh?)[B.o.B:]
There's no much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking baby I should get it out""
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
(Something that you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (we should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go (go!)
Go (Go!) Go (Heeeeey!)[Bruno Mars (B.o.B):]

And you keep it real while them other stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop... - Now think about it[B.o.B:]
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even went out there to Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show (steal the show)
And just like that girl you got me froze (got me froze)

Out of my phone i won't chase her

More seats when I'm hosting the Lakers
All I wanna hear is whatever you say sir
Swagga man so much flavor
Lake front stay on acres
I'll take you're girl to a pearl than I lase her
Than get straight chicks maker her taste her
Hard to say this the road of the paper
They keep broads coming back like acers
Land of Jamaica, wrist full of glaciers

She got that good good, she Michael Jackson bad

And now we murderers, because we kill time

Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve[one version:] Young Money thieves, steal your love and leave[another version:] Young Money thieves, steal your heart with ease[Verse 2 — Gudda Gudda:]
I like the way you walkin' if you walkin' my way

Let's buy a place with all kinds of space
I'll let you be the judge and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't even wonder, cause she know she bad
And I got her nigga, grocery bags[Chorus — Lloyd:]

She watchin' that oxygen, I'm watchin' ESPN
But when that show ends, she all on my skin lotion
Slow motions, roller coasting like back, forth, hold it (Hold it [x4])
She pose like it's for posters and I poke like I'm supposed to
Take this photo if you for me, she said don't you ever show this
I'm too loyal and too focused, to be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it
Said your words get me open, so I closed it
Where your clothes is, I'm only loving for the moment[Verse 6 — Jae Millz:]
She ain't got a man but she's not alone
Miss independent yeah she got her own
Hey gorgeous, umm, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it, this how I call it
Yeah, look at how she walk, mmhmm she know she bad
Do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain't leaving fast, Imma stay a while
Hold your head Chris, Imma take her down[Chorus — Lloyd:]

Hello, hello, baby, you called?
I can't hear a thing
I have got no service

Wha-wha-what did you say, huh?
You're breakin' up on me
Sorry I cannot hear you
I'm kinda busy
Kinda busy
Kinda busy
Sorry I cannot hear you I'm kinda busy
Just a second
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh?
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kinda busy
Stop callin'
Stop callin'

Call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club

Boy, the way you blowing up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster
Calling like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer[Lady Gaga:]
Not that I don't like you
I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing[Beyonce:]
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
'Cause I'll be dancin'
I'll be dancin'
I'll be dancin'
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls

You think I'm pretty
Without any make-up on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punchline wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel
Like I'm livin'
A teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now, baby, I believe
This is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back
We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel
And built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel
Like I'm livin'
A teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now, baby, I believe
This is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back
I'mma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
You make me feel
Like I'm livin'
A teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back, no
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now, baby, I believe
This is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back
I'mma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

Ohhhhh ohhhhhh ohhhhhh ohhhhhhh
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday
Yeah
I know, I know
When I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say
When I see your face (face, face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile, smile...)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
Yeah
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday
Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say,
When I see your face (face, face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile (smile, smile...)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing

If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all of my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't.
You think you're cooler than me.
You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face
And you wear them around like you're cooler than me.
And you never say ""Hey""
Or remember my name,
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me.
You got your high brow,
Shoes on your feet,
And you wear them around
Like they ain't shit.
But you don't know the way that you look,
When your steps make that much noise.
Shh I got you all figured out,
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Behind your make-up nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?
If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all of my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't.
You think you're cooler than me.

Just to hide your face
And you wear them around like you're cooler than me.
And you never say ""Hey""

You got your high brow,
Switch in your walk,
And you don't even look when you pass by.
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise.
Shh.
I got you all figured out,
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Behind your make-up nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?
'Cause it sure seems ('cause it sure seems)
You got no doubts (that you got no doubts)
But we all see (we all see)
You got your head in the clouds
If I could write you a song
And make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all of my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't.
You think you're cooler than me.

Yeah I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State St
Catch me in the kitchen like the Simmons' whipping Pastry
Cruisin' down 8th St., off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to TyTy, still sippin' Mai Tai's
Sittin' courtside, Knicks & Nets give me high five
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from[Alicia Keys:]
In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York
New York
You're welcome OG. I made you hot, nigga[Jay-Z:]
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
8 million stories, out there in the naked
City it's a pity, half of y'all won't make it
Me, I got a plug Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three-dice Cee-lo, three-card Monte
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the King yo, I'm from the Empire State that's[Alicia Keys:]

There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new

Let's hear it for New York, New York
New York
That boy good. Welcome to the bright light, baby[Jay-Z:]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
Or they could step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is
Lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in style
And it the winter gets cold, in Vogue with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien[Alicia Keys:]
In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York, New York
New York[Alicia Keys:]
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say ""yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"" (c'mon, c'mon)
I'm from[Alicia Keys:]
In New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen
Oh every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh I
I swear the world better prepare
For when I'm a billionaire[Travis ""Travie"" McCoy]
Yeah I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of everyday Christmas
Give Travie your wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like 'Here lady have this'
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Ha ha get it? I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, Imma have my own theme music
Oh every time I close my eyes (what you see what you see brah?)
I see my name in shining lights (uhuh uhuh yeah what else?)
A different city every night, oh I
I swear the world better prepare (for what?)
For when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire
Oh oooh oh oooh for when I'm a billionaire[Travis ""Travie"" McCoy]
I'll be playing basketball with the President
Dunking on his delegates
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twenties, tens and bens completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing[Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (so bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (buy everything ha ha)
Uh, I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (what up Oprah)
Oh every time I close my eyes (what ya see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shining lights (uh huh, uh huh, what else?)
A different city every night, oh I
I swear the world better prepare (for what?)

24,Not Afraid,Eminem,2010,Eminem,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/notafraid.html,"

I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
Now some of you, might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'mma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'mma do something I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album
He's still shitting, whether he's on salary paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt, and fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
Okay quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your feelings
Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact let's be honest
That last ""Relapse"" CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm trying to say is get back, click-clack, blow
'Cause I ain't playing around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fucking black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now! (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand-new me you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you
I've been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I wanna promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars
I feel amazing and I'm...
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holler if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)

That we would ever be more than friends
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
She like a song played again and again
That girl, like something off a poster
That girl is a dime they say
That girl is a gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night 'til the morn
Girl, you really change my life
Doing things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cooking things she likes
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife
That girl, like something off a poster
That girl is a dime they say
That girl is the gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day, ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
I can be your melody
Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me
Ay, I can be your melody
Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me
Ay, na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Shawty got me singing
Na na na na na na na

Now she got me singing
Shawty's like a melody in my head

Got me singin' like
Na na na na everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head

Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town
She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen befo'
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood, hood
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin', I can't take no more
Had to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull up close
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
(Damn, girl)
Damn, you's a sexy chick, a sexy chick
Damn, you's a sexy chick; damn, girl

I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just praying to a god that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom
'Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even
Her best days will be some of my worst
She finally met a man that's gonna put her first
While I'm wide awake she's no trouble sleeping
'Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even, no
What am I supposed to do
When the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say
When I'm all choked up and you're OK?
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
They say bad things happen for a reason
But no wise words gonna stop the bleeding
'Cause she's moved on while I'm still grieving
And when a heart breaks no it don't break even, even, no
And what am I gonna do
When the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say
When I'm all choked up and you're OK?
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
(One still in love while the other one's leaving)
I'm falling to pieces
('Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even)
Oh, you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
You took your suitcase, I took the blame
Now I'm tryna make sense of what little remains
'Cause you left me with no love and no love to my name
I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just praying to a god that I don't believe in
'Cause I got time while she got freedom
'Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't break
No, it don't break
No, it don't break even, no
What am I gonna do
When the best part of me was always you?
And what am I supposed to say
When I'm all choked up and you're OK?
(Oh glad you're okay now)
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
(Oh, I'm falling, falling)
I'm falling to pieces
(One still in love while the other one's leaving)
I'm falling to pieces
('Cause when a heart breaks, no, it don't break even)
Oh, it don't break even, no
Oh, it don't break even, no

You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude
But I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread
(Thread, thread...)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
(When I fall asleep)
Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
(Ha-ha)
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
(Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar
(Jar, jar, jar...)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

You can't stop my shine
I'm loving cloud nine
My head's in the sky
I'm solo, I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, solo

Finally doing me and it feels so right
Time to do the things I like
Going to the club everything's alright
No one to answer to
No one that's gon' argue
No
And since I got the hold off me
I'm living life now that I'm free
Telling me get my shit together
Now I got my shit together
Now I made it through the weather
Better days are gon' get better
I'm so sorry that it didn't work out
I'm moving on
I'm so sorry but it's over now
The pain is gone
I'm putting on my shades to cover up my eyes
I'm jumping in my ride, I'm heading out tonight

Never knew single could feel this good
Star player, misunderstood
Back in the game, who knew I would
So fly how I spread my wings
Loving myself makes me wanna sing
Telling me get my shit together
Now I got my shit together

Better days are gon' get better

So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows

I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My love of my life
My shorty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
Cause I knew that it just ain't right

Trying to get my Usher on but I can't let it Burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for

Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
Cause I was wrong
Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, where we gon' be?

Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feeling so fly like a G6

I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up then I let myself down
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought, I thought of every possibility
And I know some day that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet
Hmm... hmm
I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life
And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility
Somehow I know that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet
They say all's fair in love and war
But I won't need to fight it
We'll get it right and we'll be united
And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility
And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you kid I'll give more than I get, than I get, than I get, than I get
Oh you know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid to give so much more than I get yeah
I just haven't met you yet
I just haven't met you yet
Oh promise you kid to give so much more than I get
I said love love love love love love love
I just haven't met you yet

Baby, are you down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is fallin' down
Down, down
You ought to know
Tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show
I wanna see how you lose control
So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape
So, baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby, are you down?
Down, down
Baby, are you down?
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down
Just let it be
Come on and bring your body next to me
I'll take you away
Turn this place into our private getaway
So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me as we make our great escape
So why don't we run away
Baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely

Down like she's suppose to be
She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature
'Cause to me she's zero degree
She's cold, over-freeze
I got that girl from overseas
Now she's my Miss America
Now can I be her soldier, please?
I'm fighting for this girl
On the battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby Cupid
Sending arrows from above?
Don't you ever leave the side of me
And definitely, not probably
And honestly
I'm down like the economy
Baby, don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby, are you down

Down, down

Down, down

Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won't let you in again
The messages I've tried to send
My information's just not going in
I'm burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I'm not turned off to love until it's cheap
Been there, done that, messed around
I'm having fun, don't put me down
I'll never let you sweep me off my feet
This time baby,
I'll be bulletproof
This time baby,
I'll be bulletproof
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
To walk away from something when it's dead
Do, do, do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt
There are certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life's too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out
I won't let you turn around
And tell me now I'm much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt
This time baby,
I'll be bulletproof
This time baby,
I'll be bulletproof [2x]
This time...I'll be...bulletproof [2x]
This time baby,
I'll be bulletproof

She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend

46,Mine,Taylor Swift,2010,Taylor Swift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/mine.html,"

You were in college working part time waiting tables,
Left a small town, never looked back.
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts.
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I can see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now.
Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together,
And there's a drawer of my things at your place.
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded,
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes.
But we got bills to pay,
We got nothing figured out,
When it was hard to take,
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.
Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.
And I remember that fight,
Two-thirty AM,
As everything was slipping right out of our hands.
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street.
Braced myself for the ""Goodbye""
'Cause that's all I've ever known.
Then you took me by surprise.
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""
You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.
She is the best thing that's ever been mine.""
Hold on, make it last.
Hold on, never turn back.
(Hold on)
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(Hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine.
(Hold on)
Do you believe it?
(Hold on)
We're gonna make it now.
(Hold on)
And I can see it,
(Yes, yes)
I can see it now (see it now, see it now)

48,Live Like We're Dying,Kris Allen,2010,Kris Allen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/krisallen/livelikeweredying.html,"

Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say ""I love you"" enough
'Til it's too late, it's not too late
Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you,
What would you wish you would've done
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
We gotta tell them that we love them
While we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye
Should be so careful who we let fall out of our lives
So when we long for absolution,
There'll be no one on the line, yeah
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
We gotta tell them that we love them
While we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying.
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying.
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
We gotta tell them that we love them
While we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
You never know a good thing 'til it's gone
You never see a crash 'til it's head on
Why do we think we're right when we're dead wrong
You never know a good thing 'til it's gone
Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
We gotta tell them that we love them
While we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying.
Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying.
We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
Turn it all around or to throw it all away
We gotta tell them that we love them
While we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying.

No pain is forever, yup! You know this (Young!)
Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' needa try it
I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this (Young!)
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades (Shades)
Blacked-out Maybach
I'ma rock this shit like fashion
As in, going 'til they say stop (Hold up)
And my runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here (Here)
No fear
And while you're getting your cry on
I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal
I better let you know
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (So hard)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (Too hard)
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (So hard)

All up on it, know you wanna clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony (Young!)
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely (Young!)
Who think they test me now
Run through your town, I'll shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million (Young!)
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all (Hold up!)
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah
I see you aiming at my pedestal
So I think I gotta let you know
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (So hard)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (Too hard)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (Too hard)
So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
Go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon as the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""give me back my swag!"" They tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, ""Louis Mane""?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be to em
Where them girls talking trash? Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at? Where them bloggers at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where your lighters at? Where your lighters at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (Yeah!)

[Mr. Hudson:]
Let's dance in style,
Let's dance for a while,
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever,
We don't have the power but we never say never,
Sitting in a sandpit,
Life is a short trip,
The music's for the sad man,
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinking that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young[Jay-Z:]
So we live a life like a video
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
'Cause there is no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day
That lasts a whole lifetime
And it never ends
'Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed,
Drink some wine,
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut,
I'll be fine,
I'm forever young...
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever
Forever young[Jay-Z:]
Fear not when, fear not why,
Fear not much while we're alive,
Life is for living not living uptight,
'Til you're somewhere up in the sky,
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye byes are not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves,
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here,
Showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here,
And as the father passed the story down to his son's ears,
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know.
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby,
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young[Jay-Z:]
Slamming Bentley doors,
Hopping out of Porsches,
Popping up on Forbes lists,
Gorgeous,
Hold up,
Niggas thought I lost it,
They be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit
They nauseous,
Hold up,
I'll be here forever
You know, I'm on my fall shit,
And I ain't waiting for closure,
I will never forfeit,
Less than four bars,
Guru bring the chorus in,
Did you get the picture yet,
I'm painting you a portrait of young...
Forever young,
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young,

Are we just sinking in an ocean of faces?

Only when it's over our heads.

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do.
But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me,
You belong with me.
Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,
""Hey, isn't this easy?""
And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down.
You say you're fine I know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels,
I wear sneakers.
She's cheer captain,
And I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you,
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.[Instrumental]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night.
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry.
I know your favorite songs,
And you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong,
Think I know it's with me.
Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see
You belong with me.
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me,
You belong with me.
You belong with me.
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me.

Uh, uh
Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your wide screen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man

So scared of breaking it
That you won't let it bend

Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up

So let me be
And I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back
Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel
It's what I didn't show

Hi, my name is Bob, and I approve this message...[Rivers Cuomo:]
I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Everybody knows I got the magic in me
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me
Now everybody wants some presto magic
Magic, magic, magic
([scratch:] M M) Magic, magic, magic
([scratch:] M M M) Magic, magic, magic
Ah ooooooo
I got the magic in me
This trick that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse I'll hypnotize you with every line
I'll need a volunteer how about you, with the eyes
Come on down to the front and stay right here and don't be shy
I'll have you time traveling
Have your mind babbling
People trying to inherit the skills so they asking me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes and
I see Mind Freak like what's up man what's happening
So come one come all and see the show tonight
Prepared to be astounded no ghosts or poltergeists
You know I'm no Pinocchio I never told a lie
So call me Mister Magic Man I float on cloud 9[Rivers Cuomo:]
I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track in turns into gold (yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me (they be snappin', baby)
Now everybody wants some presto 
Magic, magic, magic
([scratch:] M M) Magic, magic, magic
([scratch:] M M M) Magic, magic, magic
Ah oooooooo
I got the magic in me
We'll take a journey into my mind
You'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage go insane and jump into that crowd
See, see when I rhyme I flow on the beat like pidda-da-da
See I deceive ya with my intergalactic ether
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, blowing sticky like adhesive
Be cautious 'cause what I be on'll leave you with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel
It's a spectacular show cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you saying it don't entertain my ego
I do this every day Hocus Pocus is my steelo[Rivers Cuomo:]
I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track in turns into gold (yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)

You wanted all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes 
That what you want right now

I think you need to close yo mouth 
Cuz you aint gon tie me down, tie me down, tie me down 
You aint gon tie me down [Verse 1 - Legacy]
Know we been together for a minute 
But a, it's kinda been forever since we been in 
The kinda situation not involving other women 
And it's pretty obvious that you're kinda trippin, like 
""Who the hell is this bitch lookin a hot mess 
What you fell for this chick"" 
You know we got problems and you failed to fix it 
I'm like, ""you need to go somewhere else with this shit 
Cuz I aint gon put up wit you 
Talkin bout how she make you uncomfortable 
I mean, shit I'm only 17 
And um, a perfect couples only in a dream 
And right now I'm pretty much away for this relationship 
I think we should wait for it 
I mean later we can try things out 
But not right now [Chorus - Ray J]
Cuz She aint gon tie me down 
So why you on the road 
You wanted all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes 
That what you want right now 
What up right now,

Cuz you aint gon tie me down, tie me down, tie me down 
You aint gon tie me down [Verse 2 - Ben J]

Buh you cant tie me down like a pair of shoe strings 
Yea you cute, so what 
But let's get it through your head 
Yea we make love, sex weed all in the bed 
It's the best and I love her but things dont change 
When I'm not faithful you be feelin ma pain 
Now you stuck like a stain and I cant believe that 
Baby girl one hundred,I aint tryna do that 
Got too many girls and I aint letting go 
Cuz my life is great and you aint nothin but a hoe 
Yea you come to my shows and you very supportive 
Just showed me a camera and my show recorded 
It was nice, I'm surprised that you still standin here 
As you know I'm a man and I have no feelings 
Imma start from the top, girl this aint no lovin 
Im a New Boy, girl so [Chorus - Ray J]

In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree

Ready to give up on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him

Merrier the more
Triple fun that way
Twister on the floor
What do you say?
Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing
Are you in?
I am counting
One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got 180 degrees and I'm caught in between
Countin' one, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves
Countin' one, two, three
Not only you and me
Got 180 degrees and I'm caught in between
Countin' one, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves
Three is a charm
Two is not the same
I don't see the harm
So are you game?
Let's make a team
Make 'em say my name
Loving the extreme
Now, are you game?
Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing
Are you in?
I am counting
One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got 180 degrees and I'm caught in between
Countin' one, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves
Countin' one, two, three
Not only you and me
Got 180 degrees and I'm caught in between
Countin' one, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves
What we do is innocent
Just for fun and nothing meant
If you don't like the company
Let's just do it you and me
You and me
Or three
Or four on the floor
One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got 180 degrees and I'm caught in between
Countin' one, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves
Countin' one, two, three
Not only you and me
Got 180 degrees and I'm caught in between
Countin' one, two, three
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P, everybody loves

70,Impossible,Shontelle,2010,Shontelle,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shontelle/impossible.html,"

I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won
You can go ahead tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know
And now when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
(Let me tell you now)
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible!
Ooh impossible (yeah yeah)
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
(Let me tell you now)
Impossible, impossible
(Let me tell you now)
Impossible, impossible
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they're gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought hey
You know, this could be something
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one
I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing
Then maybe it's true that I can't live without you
Maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought, hey (hey, hey)
Maybe it's true that I can't live without you
Maybe two is better than one
There's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking, ooh, I can't live without you
'Cause, baby, two is better than one
There's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
But I've figured out with all that's said and done
Two is better than one, two is better than one

Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would have worked out right
We were never meant for ""do or die""
I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you now
I can't stop
I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone
Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
Started with the perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
""Perfect"" couldn't keep this love alive
You know that I love you so
I love you enough to let you go
I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone
I'm already gone, I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right
When you know that it's wrong
I'm already gone, already gone
There's no moving on
So I'm already gone
Ah, already gone, already gone, already gone
Ah, already gone, already gone, already gone
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go

I need another story
Something to get off my chest
My life gets kinda boring
Need something that I can confess
'Til all my sleeves are stained red
From all the truth that I've said
Come by it honestly I swear
Thought you saw me wink, no
I've been on the brink, so
Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
Sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
My God, amazing how we got this far
It's like we're chasing all those stars
Who's driving shiny big black cars
And everyday I see the news
All the problems that we could solve
And when a situation rises
Just write it into an album
Send it straight to gold
But I don't really like my flow, no, so
Tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
Sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time, don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
Oh, got no reason, got no shame
Got no family I can blame
Just don't let me disappear
I'ma tell you everything
So tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
Sick of all the insincere
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
This time, don't need another perfect lie
Don't care if critics ever jump in line
I'm gonna give all my secrets away
So tell me what you want to hear
Something that will light those ears
Sick of all the insincere

How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own and I can tell
It comes naturally, it comes naturally
You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive, you don't have to try
It comes naturally, mmmm, it comes naturally
And it takes my breath away (away, away, away)
What you do so naturally (turally, turally, turally)
You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are and to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby
You have a way of moving me
A force of nature, your energy
It comes naturally (you know it does), it comes naturally
Mmmm, yeah
And it takes my breath away (away, away) every time
What you do so naturally
You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are and to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Ba-ba-baby
When we collide sparks fly
When you look in my eyes
It takes my breath away
You are
You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are and to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby

Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight, who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say, you should say it right now

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it

And I can't take it

If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?

Mmm better, mmm better
Absolutely no one that knows me better
No one that can make me feel so good
How did we stay so long together
When everybody, everybody said we never would?
And just when I
I start to think they're right
The love has died
There you go making my heart beat again, heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time?
There you go pulling me right back in, right back in, right back in
And I know
I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you
Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue
Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue
Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days you know I wanna just give up
When it doesn't matter who's right
Fight about it all night
Had enough
You give me that look
I'm sorry baby let's make up
You do that thing that makes me laugh
And just like that
There you go making my heart beat again, heart beat again, heart beat again

There you go pulling me right back in, right back in, right back in

What you gonna do with that?
Come on over here with that
Sugar-sticky sweet stuff
Come on give me that stuff
Everybody wants some
Melodies that get stuck
Up in your head
Up in your head
Up in your head
Up in your head
Stuck like glue
You and me together, say, it's all I wanna do
I said
There you go making my heart beat again, heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time?
There you go pulling me right back in, right back in, right back in
And I know
I'm never letting this go
There you go making my heart beat again, heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time?
There you go pulling me right back in, right back in, right back in
And I know
I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you
Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue
Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue
Stuck like glue
You and me baby we're stuck like glue

Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey T-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there
But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
Yeah, it really sucks, but ever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way we fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life was good, but me and you, we a catastrophe
If I was a success, oh, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic, girl, I'm feelin' paralyzed
If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me
The more money I made, you actin' like my enemy
It's crazy, I can't help it if you feelin' change
Thought the pressure would turn you to my diamond babe
How could somethin' so familiar be so strange?
Closest friends gettin' strange when your status change
Why is it my mistake that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that have my back?
We were the perfect pair, and now it seem that we don't match
Is it the money? Want me to give it back?
This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change

When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there
But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
I'm gon' need you to say something baby
Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement
To a condo downtown 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?
This shit was all I knew
You and me only
I did it all for you
Still you were lonely
We coulda worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standing there
But, I'm gonna need you to say something baby
Say something baby, say something baby, say something baby

Turn the lights on!
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes
I'm going outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on!)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air
('Cause you're my, you're my...)
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real and tell me you'll stay by my side
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death can make us part
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on!)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true

My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, long as you're here

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me, somebody
I'm ready now [x7]
Someone like you, somebody [x3]

Always looking down at all I see

I should have known by the way you passed me by
There was something in your eyes and it wasn't right
I should have walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand and I let it slide
Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be
The way it was before I saw your face
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
Na, na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na
Na, na, na-na, na, na
Now your photos don't have a picture frame
And I never say your name and I never will
And all your things, well I threw them in the trash
And I'm not even sad
Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always gonna be the same
And, oh no, you'll never change
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack

I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

You want my future, you can't have it
I'm still trying to erase you from my past
I need you gone so fast
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride

Who else really tryin' to fuck with Hollywood Co.?
I'm with Marley G. bro
Flyin' Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you somethin' that you probably should know
This that ""Slumdog millionaire"" Bollywood flow and uh..
My real friends never hear it from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose
I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle
I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same buildin', but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single
I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I've been sippin' so this shit is movin' kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go[Chorus:]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven's right above it
We on, it's Young Money, motherfucker
If you ain't runnin' with it run from it, motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my bees with me like some honey in this bitch, ya dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first..[Verse 2 - Lil' Wayne:]
Meet me on the fresh train
Yes I'm in the buildin'
You just on the list of guest names
And all my riders do not give a fuck: X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies: sex change..
And I smoke til' I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some vans
Call me Triple-A, get my advance in advance, Amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand
Ugh. Wake up and smell a pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on the paper trail, there ain't no tellin' where it took me, yeah
And I ain't a killer, but don't push me[Chorus][Verse 3 - Lil' Wayne:]
Ugh. How do he say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman
I bet that bitch look better red
Limpin' off tour 'cause I made more on my second leg
Motherfuckin' Birdman junior, eleventh grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense.. Check the paw prints..
We in the buildin', you niggas in apartments
Ugh. N-now c'mon be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't even gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at?
From where did they gumbo at?
Kane got the fucking beat jumpin' like a jumpin' jack
And you know me
I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop I'm the heart of that
Nigga nothin' short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat. Ugh.[Chorus]
Yeah... We on... Young moola baby!

91,The House That Built Me,Miranda Lambert,2010,Miranda Lambert,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mirandalambert/thehousethatbuiltme.html,"

I know they say you can't go home again.
I just had to come back one last time.
Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam.
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine.
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar.
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard.
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.
Mama cut out pictures of houses for years.
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine.
Plans were drawn, concrete poured,
And nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to mama's dream.
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.
You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can.
I got lost in this old world and forgot who I am.
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could walk around I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in a river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Uh oh, uh oh
Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors, oh,
And life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
I've had just enough time
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
I've had just enough time
And I'll be wearing white, when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger,
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand,
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever,
Who would have thought forever could be severed by...
...the sharp knife of a short life, oh well?
I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts, oh, no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin'
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Uh oh (uh, oh)
The ballad of a dove (uh, oh)
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh
The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls.

93,The Only Exception,Paramore,2010,Paramore,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/paramore/theonlyexception.html,"

When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind.
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it.
And my momma swore
That she would never let herself forget.
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist.
But darling,
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts.
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone.
Or keep a straight face.
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance.
And up until now I have sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness.
Because none of it was ever worth the risk.
Well you are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
You are the only exception.
I've got a tight grip on reality,
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here.
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up.
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream.
Oh-oh-oh-ohhh.
You are the only exception. [4x]
You are the only exception. [4x]
And I'm on my way to believing.
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing.

She grew up on the side of the road
Where the church bells ring

Steady as a preacher
Free as a weed

So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey
There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name
Like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days
As the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey
Get caught in the race of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything
Can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
To American honey
There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name
Like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days
As the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey
Gone for so long now
I gotta get back to her somehow
To American honey
There's a wild wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name
Like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days
As the years go by
Nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey
And American honey
Ooh

Keep drinkin' coffee
Stare me down across the table
While I look outside
So many things I'd say if only I were able
But I just keep quiet
And count the cars that pass by
You've got opinions, man
We're all entitled to 'em
But I never asked
So let me thank you for your time
And try not to waste any more of mine
Get out of here fast
I hate to break it to you, babe
But I'm not drowning
There's no one here to save
Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything?
You sound so innocent
All full of good intent
You swear you know best
But you expect me to
Jump up on board with you
And ride off into your delusional sunset
I'm not the one who's lost
With no direction oh
But you'll never see
You're so busy makin' maps
With my name on them in all caps
You've got the talkin' down
Just not the listening
And who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything?
All my life
I've tried
To make everybody happy while I
Just hurt
And hide
Waitin' for someone to tell me it's my turn
To decide
Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything?
Who cares if you disagree?
You are not me
Who made you king of anything?
So you dare tell me who to be
Who died and made you king of anything?
Let me hold your crown, babe

96,Life After You,Daughtry,2010,Daughtry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daughtry/lifeafteryou.html,"

Ten miles from town and I just broke down
Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong but you already know
Believe me I won't stop at nothin'
To see you so I've started runnin'
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you
Last time we talked, the night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back of my mind
I must've been high to say you and I
Weren't meant to be and just wasting my time
Oh, why did I ever doubt you?
You know I would die here without you
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you
You and I, right or wrong, there's no other one
After this time I spent alone
It's hard to believe that a man with sight could be so blind
Thinkin' 'bout the better times, must've been outta my mind
So I'm runnin' back to tell you
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you God knows what I'd do
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

You're better than the best
I'm lucky just to linger in your light
Cooler than the flip-side of my pillow (that's right)
Completely unaware
Nothing can compare to where you send me
It lets me know that it's okay (yeah, it's okay)
And the moments when my good times start to fade
You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile
Even when you're gone
Somehow you come along
Just like a flower poking through the sidewalk crack
And just like that
You steal away the rain
And just like that
You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile
Don't know how I lived without you
'Cause every time that I get around you
I see the best of me inside your eyes
You make me smile
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile
(Oh, you make me smile)
Oh, you make me smile

Oh, you make me smile

Aye! Aye!
Teach me how to dougie (aye!)[Verse 1:]
They be like smoove (what?)
Can you teach me how to dougie?
You know why?
'Cause all the bitches love me (aye)
All I need is a beat that's super bumping
And for you, you, and you to back it up and dump it!
Put your arms out front, lean side to side
They gon' be on you when they see you hit that dougie right
Ain't nobody fucking with my bro from morning side
He go by bubba and he hit that dance like thunder
I ain't from Dallas but I d-town boogie
I show my moves off, now everybody tryna do me
I leave the function and all the ladies tryna screw me
Now you just do you and I'm a do me (all day)
Niggas love to hate so they try to screw me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they tryna glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started glooming
This beat was bubble gum so I had to chew it[Chorus 2x:]
Teach me how to dougie
Teach me, teach me how to dougie
Teach me how to dougie
Teach me, teach me how to dougie
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You ain't fucking with my dougie![Verse 2:]
The name is Young!
For the dudes who don't know me
I know I'm from the West but I can teach you how to dougie!
Step up in the club and all these bitches bug me
All the niggas dancing, none of them know me
I hear the crowd screaming like ""Aye! get it brody!""
So I'm on my shoulders and I take it real low
They like ""How we do that?"", he can dougie on the floor
And when that nigga stop they like ""Dougie, some more!""
I'm like a nigga kinda tired so, and I pass it to the bro!
M-bone! Show these cats how to do that down south dance
That we learned a little too fast and bought it to the hood
And got the whole crew ask[Chorus 2x][Verse 3:]
Back of the party I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryna get bent and meet a thick redbone
(Mmm) we do the dougie and all them bitches hating
But I'm about to escape with a bitch and head home (fuck it)
She got her friend so it's a two man hand
I wanna run it even if her leg's long
She like you hubby, I think she love me but
I change the subject and I do my dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove heifen the back with playboy bunnies
We gon' make 'em do the dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head this bitch looked at me funny
Dahhhh! Bitch, you can't tell me nothing
Star made the beat, I just took it out the oven
I just see the dougie when everybody clubbing
And I hate skinny jeans 'cause the burner keep rubbing! (oh!)[Chorus 2x]

Let's do it, baby, let's do it, baby
Let's do it, do it
Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Telling me, touch me, feel me
And all the time you were telling me lies
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, only nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me
Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
With you
Right 'til the end
Oh
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's about to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
Or just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Oh, Lord
Have you ever tried sleeping with a
Without my love
Have you ever tried, have you ever tried?

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all

We could have had it all

It all, it all, it all

Rolling in the deep

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you?
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a wasted space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt your heart will glow
And when it's time you'll know
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through, -ough, -ough
'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""

Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all
But you never give
Should've known you was trouble
From the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is...
I'd catch a grenade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said ""Hey"" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is...
I'd catch a grenade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
If my body was on fire
Oh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
But, darling, I'd still catch a grenade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Oh, you'd never do the same
Oh, no no no, oh

We're the best!
Lock the exits
You have just awaken the sleeping giants

All Handz On Deck
Cris Cab
Wanna talk to the girls
When a woman's fed up, your car gets keyed up
She'll call 911, and police they show up
They don't need no reason, to put you in prison
She gives the order - Rikers Island
I used to hold you in my arms,
Now you're holding me at arms
Ticky ticky tack, till they're startin' the alarm.
Yeah, there's a riot in the bedroom
And I don't know if I'ma make it alive or in the tomb
She shoot me one time, she shoot me two times
She shoot me three times, she shoot me four times
And that feels like I've been hit with Rihanna's gun!
Oh, one time
Oh, two times
Oh, three times
Oh, four times
And I never got the chance to apologize!
So baby girl, these are two roses
I picked them from your garden
I'm begging for your pardon
Please take me back in the morning!
Oh, these are the roses
I picked them from your garden
I'm begging for your pardon
Please take me back in the morning!
She was targeting, targeting, targeting… my heart
I know she was up to something when I saw her in the dark
Her hand was on the burner, and my things were in the yard
My hat, my shoes, my clothes, and my nylon string guitar
I told her that I loved her, but I guess it's not enough
She sliced up all my tires, so I had to take the bus
I never would admit it, so she told me we were done
She said she found a paper with Stacy's number on the front.
She shoot me one time, she shoot me two times
She shoot me three times, she shoot me four times
And that feels like I've been hit with Rihanna's gun!
Oh, one time
Oh, two times
Oh, three times
Oh, four times
And I never got the chance to apologize!
So baby girl, these are the roses
I picked them from your garden
I'm begging for your pardon
Please take me back in the morning!
Oh, these are the roses
I picked them from your garden
I'm begging for your pardon
Please take me back in the morning!
Gal how could you ever do me this
When you did shoot, make you never did miss?
Sweet words from your damn pretty lips
And you shoot up the benz and take way me drist
You nuh see the gully life at stake
From you sleep in a bed with the snake
Get carried away by the sexy shape and me drop asleep and wake
She captured me
Without a fight
Well baby girl
It's quite alright
They say two wrongs, don't make it right
She say why you carry roses to a gun fight
And suddenly, I went outta sight
No guns, but roses,
I picked them from your garden
I'm begging for your pardon
Please take me back in the morning!
Oh, these are the roses
I picked them from your garden
I'm begging for your pardon
Please take me back in the morning!
Rihanna's gun!

But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you

He be coming home late, he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
Then say, ""Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits, yeah?""

There's a stranger in my bed,
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a mini-bar
DJs passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise
Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh, well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail
Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh, well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say
When I see your face (face, face...)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (amazing)
Just the way you are (are)

The whole world stops and stares for a while

If perfect's what you're searching for

You got that something
That keeps me so off balance
Baby, you're a challenge
Let's explore your talent
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me

And ain't nowhere that I'd be
Than with your arms around me
Back and forth, you rock me, yeah
So I surrender
To every word you whisper
Every door you enter
I will let you in

That's why you take me
Way past the point of turning me on
You 'bout to break me
I swear you got me losing my mind

I don't see how you can hate from outside of the club
You can't even get in!
Hahaha
Leggo
Yellow model chick, yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupée
I get what you get in 10 years in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari
Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said ""On my dick""
I ain't really mean to say ""On my dick""
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done
Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Let's go!
'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref'
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it (Have it)
Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka
Man, fuck these bitch-ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit
No, I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my Jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with an elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said ""shoot 'em"", and I said ""okay""
If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, ""¡Olé!""
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
(Nope) Not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CÎROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, ""Fuck trial""
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch!
Look at me now, look at me now (Ha ha! Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Ha ha! Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka
Okay
Okay

23,How To Love,Lil Wayne,2011,Lil Wayne,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lilwayne/howtolove.html,"

Cut the music up a little louder
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you're in a corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Never had a love
When you was just a youngin' your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you're in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault
Wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me
Be the one listenin'
But I admire your popping bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
See I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
And I want you to know, you're far from the usual
Far from the usual
You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love

24,Someone Like You,Adele,2011,Adele,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/adele/someonelikeyou.html,"

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead""
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.""
Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes
They are memories made.
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"".
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.""

Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say
Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there is to complain about
When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You gotta take it in
Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Hopelessly
I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly
I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly
I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly
The hope is we have so much to feel good about
Oh this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life
Oh yeah
Good, good life
Good life
Ooh
Listen
To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so

Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.
Uh!
I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't
I'll be lounging on the couch,
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man
Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great!)
Yeah
I might mess around, and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
Haha
Oh, yes I said it

I just wanna lay in my bed

No, I ain't gonna comb my hair

Get you off with the touch dancing in the dark

You know that I can take it,

Just remember when you come up

Have you ever had the feeling
That you was being had
Don't that shit that make you mad
They treat you like a slave
With chains all on your soul
And put whips up on your back
They be lying through they teeth
Hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up I just laugh
Put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by their threats
Then get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glittering may not be gold
Don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy
You never have to pay me
Go on and put your hands up
When times is hard you stand up
L-U-P the man
'Cause the brand
That the fans trust
So even if they ban us
They'll never slow my plans up![2x]

Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don't wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna to hold them back
Five in the air for the teacher not scared
To tell those kids that's living in the ghetto
That the niggas holding back that the world is theirs!
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours
I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world
Now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything
Even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I'm rapping 'round the world for!
Africa to New York
Haiti then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland
Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy
Tell 'em look at me, boy!

And never be a D-boy[2x]

No matter what you're into
No matter what you see
When you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass
Picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down
You just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired
Let 'em know you're here
That you're struggling survivin'
That you gon' persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leaving
Nobody goin' home

Uno, dos, tres
It's been a really really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime but it's time for me to quit her
La la la, whatever, la la la, it doesn't matter, la la la, oh, well, la la la
We're going at it tonight tonight
There's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it but watch how good I'll fake it
It's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
I woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it, not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis (Huh!)
La la la, whatever, la la la, it doesn't matter, la la la, oh, well, la la la
We're going at it tonight tonight
There's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it but watch how good I'll fake it
It's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
You got me singing like, whoa,
Come on, oh,
It doesn't matter, whoa,
Everybody now, oh
Just don't stop let's keep the beat pumpin'
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party dance if I want to
We can get crazy let it all out
Just don't stop let's keep the beat pumpin'
Keep the beat up, let's drop the beat down
It's my party dance if I want to
We can get crazy let it all out
It's you and me and we're running this town
And it's me and you and we're shaking the ground
And ain't nobody gonna tell us to go cause this is our show
Everybody, whoa,
Come on, oh,
All you animals, whoa,
Let me hear you now, oh
Tonight tonight there's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight tonight and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it but watch how good I'll fake it
It's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
It's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
Yeah it's all right, all right, tonight, tonight
Just singing like, whoa,
Come on, oh,
All you party people, whoa,
All you singletons, oh

[Bruno Mars:]
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters[Eminem:]
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck, like lightning,
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point 'em skyward uh
Had a dream, I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking,
'Til nobody else even fucking feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Popping shit on how you flipped your life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks tryna kid?
Flip ""dick"", you did opposite
You stayed the same,
'Cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock"" you pricks
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
'Cause it wasn't that, long ago when Marshall sat, flustered lacked luster
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up, nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzzin'
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circlin' around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, scuzzes, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
That this ain't some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's ribcage
And let it be known that from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em Bics raise 'cause I came with 5'9"" but I feel like I'm 6'8″![Bruno Mars:]
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters[Royce Da 5'9"":]
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did, Dr. Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up, must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Ya'll are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and autotunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all bugging out like Wendy Williams staring at a beehive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal and now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag...[Bruno Mars:]
You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight
But tonight, we're alright
So hold up your lights
Let it shine
'Cause, this one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

35,If I Die Young,The Band Perry,2011,The Band Perry,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bandperry/ifidieyoung.html,"

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in a river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Uh oh, uh oh
Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors, oh,
And life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
I've had just enough time
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
I've had just enough time
And I'll be wearing white, when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger,
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand,
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever,
Who would have thought forever could be severed by...
...the sharp knife of a short life, oh well?
I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts, oh, no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin'
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Uh oh (uh, oh)
The ballad of a dove (uh, oh)
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh
The sharp knife of a short life, oh well
I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls.

[Adam Levine:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo[Travie McCoy:]
Gym Class Heroes baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yea [scratched], check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you[Adam Levine:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo[Travie McCoy:]
Let's go!
If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox (remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops (turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop?
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mix tape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you[Adam Levine:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo
I only pray you never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine (yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh (it's your boy Travis!) oh oh oh (Gym Class Heroes baby!) so sing along to my stereo
Yeah

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming[Diddy:]
I'm back where I belong (yeah)
I never felt so strong, man (I'm back, baby)
I feel like there's nothing I can't try
And if you feel me put your hands high (put your hands high)
If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you
(Baby, put your hands high)
And you, the dreams are for you
I hear the ""Tears of a Clown,"" uh, I hate that song
I always feel like they're talking to me, when it comes on (come on)
Another day, another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone
What am I supposed to do when the club lights come on?
It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean
What if my twins ask why I ain't marry their mom?
Damn, how do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night, the inevitable prolongs
Another day, another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'
(I'll be better in the morn')
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place where I belong[Skylar Grey:]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home

All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home[Diddy:]
""A House Is Not a Home,"" I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it, and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it (deal with it), and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, playboy, and we keep ballin' (ballin')
Baby, we've been living in sin
Cause we've been really in love, but we been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone, come on[Skylar Grey:]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming[Diddy:]
""Ain't No Stopping Us Now,"" I love that song
Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
Til we back cruising through Harlem, these old blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away, then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big!)
But here I stand (here I stand), a better man
Thank you, Lord! Thank you all[Skylar Grey:]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world that I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming

Only girl in the world

'Cause I'm the only one who understands
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh, baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Oh, make it last all night, night
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh, baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Make it last all night
Want you to make me feel

[Hook]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch[Lil Wayne - Verse 1]
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
you don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for Finisher
so misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
life is the bitch, and death is her sister
sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture
you know father time, we all know mother nature
it's all in the family, but I am of no relation
no matter who's buying, I'm a celebration
black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money running shit and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'mma keep on doing this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tunafish[Hook]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch[Lil Wayne - Verse 2]
I'm going back in
okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
but hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self defense
swear man, I be seeing through these niggas like sequins
niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
talking to myself because I am my own consultant
married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
you full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt
stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
real nigga all day and tomorrow
but these motherfuckers talking crazy like they jaw broke
glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
try me and run into a wall, outfielder
You know I'mma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
the fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king do
if these niggas animals, then I'mma have a mink soon
tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
and I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
but most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
paper chasing, tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
people say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
you niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
yeah, with a swag you would kill for
money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell[Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda
bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold/bald like Cuba
and I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be macking, 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out their mind
I done told these fuck niggas, so many times
that I keep them bucks steady on my mind
tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
to feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love?
keep throwing my sign in the middle
hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shooting when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard?

Lyin' here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
I'm caught up in your smile
I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
No, we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight
I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real, no, it's never felt so right
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight
No, I don't wanna say goodnight
I know it's time to leave, but you'll be in my dreams
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby I'm alright, oh, let's do this right, with just a kiss goodnight
With a kiss goodnight
Kiss goodnight

43,Dirt Road Anthem,Jason Aldean,2011,Jason Aldean,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonaldean/dirtroadanthem.html,"

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Back in the day Potts farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbed wire, spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack n' Jim were a few good men
Where you learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And, all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread?
Like I know somethin' y'all don't know,
Man that talk is gettin' old
You better mind your business man,
Watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin' man y'all ain't listenin'
Them ol' dirt roads, is what y'all missin'
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
I sit back and think about them good old days
The way we were raised in our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke 'round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
So if you really want to know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in and man tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the black top ends
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right

To need release
Uncontrollably[Chorus: x2]

There's a countdown waitin' for me to errupt

I'm getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don't mean
Like what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy
But get it while you here boy
'Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
and I'll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Tripping off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient,
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate your rumours, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations,
I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it![Drake:]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody should've told ya
I'm on one
fuck it, I'm on one
I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit
'Cause I'm on one
I said fuck it I'm on one[Rick Ross:]
I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
Check it.
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills
Boss
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I'm out on bond I might be facin' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair

And it's double M G until I get the chair[Drake:]

Too much money, ain't enough money

I'm a maid nigga
I should dust something
You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas
I'm focused might as well say cheese for the pictures
Oh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel Tov
It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil

50,Moment 4 Life,Nicki Minaj Featuring Drake,2011,Nicki Minaj,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nickiminaj/moment4life.html,"

I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire
In this very moment I'm king
In this very moment I slay Goliath with a sling
In this very moment I bring, put it on everything
That I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavy weight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
South side Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters,
Sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that what we done this moment
Will be syndicated, I don't know
This night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they could think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of
I wish that I could have this moment
For life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment I just feel so
Alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment
For life, for life, for life
This is my moment I just feel so
Alive, alive, alive[Drake:]
When I tell them hoes bow, bow, bow to me
Drop down to your knees
Young Money, the mafia, that's where the love cease
I'm in a Dominican, Big Papi Ortiz
Doing Target Practice
All these Bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the C.E.O., 500 degrees
Shout out to the O.V.O. Red wings and Fatigues ah
Niggas wanna be friends,
How coincidental, this was supposed to be ya'll year?
We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
Forty got a bunch of weed, he ain't even rolled
These niggas be dropping songs
They ain't even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home...Yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki nick getting married today
And all you bitches that be hating
Can catch the bouquet
Ooh, yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a little more, I could hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it
I'm partly surprised
I swear, damn, this one for the books
Man, I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really trying to make it more than what it is
Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives
I wish that I could have this moment
For life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment I just feel so
Alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment
For life, for life, for life
This is my moment I just feel so
Alive, alive, alive
This is my moment
I waited all my
Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm
One with the sunsets
I have become alive
I wish that I could have this moment
For life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment I just feel so
Alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment
For life, for life, for life
This is my moment I just feel so
Alive, alive, alive, alive

51,I Need A Doctor,Dr. Dre Featuring Eminem & Skylar Grey,2011,Dr. Dre,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/drdre/ineedadoctor.html,"

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Doubts starting to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, but they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do 'cause
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fucking be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you, who believed in me when everyone was telling
You don't sign me, everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
(I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life)
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was riding to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fucking back-stabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Making wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they'll scream, ""Dre, don't leave us like that man!"" 'cause
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

Uhh, uhh, uhh

Thinking 'bout us, where we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My love of my life
My shorty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
Cause I knew that it just ain't right
Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, where we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah

When I be ridin man I swear I see her face at every turn
Trying to get my Usher on but I can't let it Burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for
My woman, oh I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
Cause I was wrong
Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, where we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wishing you could give them everything

I know I can't take one more step towards you
'Cause all that's waiting is regret
Don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most
I learned to live half alive
And now you want me one more time
And who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?
I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms
And I've learned to live half alive
And now you want me one more time
And who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Who do you think you are?
And it took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises
And now you're back
You don't get to get me back
And who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold
From the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me
Don't come back at all

Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
Tearing love apart

60,Hold It Against Me,Britney Spears,2011,Britney Spears,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/britneyspears/holditagainstme.html,"

[Verse 1]
Hey, over there
Please, forgive me
If I'm comin' on too strong
Hate to stare
But, you're winnin'
And they're playin' my favorite song
So, come here
A little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear
A little question
Wanna know just how you feel[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?[Verse 2]
Hey, you might think
That I'm crazy
But, you know I'm just your type
I might be
A little hazy
But, you just cannot deny
There's a spark
In between us
When we're dancin' on the floor
I want more
Wanna see it
So, I'm askin' you tonight[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
If I said I want your body
Would you hold it against me?
Yeah
Uh-huh
Oh[Bridge]
Give me somethin' good
Don't wanna wait
I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out
Alright
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

Watch me as I dance under the spotlight- 
listen to the people screaming out more, and more
Cos I create the feeling that keep em coming back, 
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep em coming back, 
So captivating when I get it on the floor. 
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it, 
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that Monster in the mirror, 
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner. 
Best when under pressure with seconds left I show up. [CHORUS x2] 
If you really want more, scream it out louder, 
if you on the floor, bring out the fire, 
And light it up, take it up higher, 
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more. 
Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite 
put em in the air, if you more (and) more, 
Cos I can't wait to feel it. 
I go hard, can't stop, 
But if I stop just know that Imma bring it back, 
Never quittin' don't believe in that. 
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it,

[Eric Turner:]
Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way[Tinie Tempah:]
Lets go...
Yeah
You're listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fucking hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrrrap's, brrrrrraps
Man I'm like a young gun fully black barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to earth
I'm bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
Where the hell's all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out
Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...[Tinie Tempah:]
Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never tipped 'cause we needed the change
I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say the money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry it keeps you awake
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed
Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man!
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming until they hear you out
Oh written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main
Oh seasons come and go
But I will never change (we won't change)
And I'm on my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Issie!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Eric Turner!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Let's go!)
Oh seasons come and go
But I will never change (we won't change)
And I'm on my way

While I'm drinking jack all alone in my local bar,

Only doing things out of frustration

She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time,
I've got a new job now on the unemployment line,
And we don't know how,
How we got into this mess

And you know I ain't good at this stuff

Won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways. Yeah, maybe

But I'll do my best

I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shady tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee
Yeah, that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smiling, honey
Right back at me
Now hold on 'cause I ain't done
There's more where that came from
Well, you know I'm just havin' fun
But seriously
You'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You'll be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea

Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do but fall in each other's arms
I coulda said a ""I love you""
Coulda wrote you a line or two
Baby, all I know to do is speak right from the heart
If you'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady

Touching your skin, and your hair falling slow

Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way

Let's take it slow, I don't wanna move too fast
I don't wanna just make love, I wanna make love last

Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?

Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more

It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I’d give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you
He said, sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me
Somethin', somethin' about this place
Somethin', 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about, baby, you and I
It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or rock 'n' roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me ""A Heart Of Gold""
With a guitar hummin' and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you
Ooh-oh ooh-oh
Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me
Somethin', somethin' about this place
Somethin', 'bout lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about, baby, you and I
You and I, you, you and I
You, you and I, you, you and I
You and I, you, you and I
Oh, yeah, I'd rather die
Without you and I
C'mon!
Put your drinks up!
We got a whole lot of money but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in heaven
There's only three men that I'mma serve my whole life
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ
Somethin', somethin' about the chase (six whole years)
I'm a New York woman born to run you down
Still want my lipstick all over your face
Somethin', somethin' about just knowing when it's right
So put your drinks up for Nebraska,
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love ya
You and I, you, you and I
Baby I rather die
Without you and I
You and I, you, you and I
Nebraska, I'd rather die,
Without you and I
It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you

I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game
Without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you
I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by
Without you, without you
I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I
Without you, without you
Oh oh oh!
You! You! You!
Without...
You! You! You!
Without... you
I can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged
Without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you, without you
I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed
Without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind
Without you, without you

Without...

74,Back To December,Taylor Swift,2011,Taylor Swift,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/taylorswift/backtodecember.html,"

I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life? Tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier than ever.
We small-talk, work and the weather.
Your guard is up and I know why.
Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.
So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night,""
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I go back to December all the time.
These days I haven't been sleeping,
Staying up, playing back myself leavin'.
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times,
I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
And realized I loved you in the fall.
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was ""Goodbye"".
So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night.""
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind.
I go back to December all the time.
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile.
So good to me, so right.
And how you held me in your arms that September night:
The first time you ever saw me cry.
Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming,
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.
So if the chain is on your door I understand.
But this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you, saying, ""I'm sorry for that night.""
And I go back to December.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time.
All the time.

You think I'm pretty
Without any make-up on
You think I'm funny
When I tell the punchline wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright
But things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February
You'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel
Like I'm livin'
A teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now, baby, I believe
This is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back
We drove to Cali
And got drunk on the beach
Got a motel
And built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you
My missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel
Like I'm livin'
A teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now, baby, I believe
This is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back
I'mma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me
In my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
You make me feel
Like I'm livin'
A teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back, no
My heart stops
When you look at me
Just one touch
Now, baby, I believe
This is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back,
Don't ever look back
I'mma get your heart racing
In my skin-tight jeans

Be your teenage dream tonight

A full moon shining bright
Edge of the water we were feelin' alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smiled when we rolled by
They'd hop in the back and we'd cruise to the river side
Woah, never gonna grow up
Woah, never gonna slow down
Woah
We were shining like lighters in the dark in the middle of a rock show
Woah, we were doing it right
Woah, we were comin' to life
Woah Yeah, caught up in a southern summer barefoot blue jean night
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' looking pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town and new to me
Her ruby red lips were sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me a look like a shootin' star
So I grabbed a beer and my old guitar
Then we sat around ‘til the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite songs
Woah, never gonna grow up
Woah, never gonna slow down
Woah 
We were shining like lighters in the dark in the middle of a rock show
Woah, we were doing it right
Woah, we were comin' to life

Gonna put the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine gonna wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way
Wishing I was knee-deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
Wrote a note said ""Be back in a minute""
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody's gonna miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away
'Cause now I'm knee-deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be
Knee-deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
Come on in the water's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack and lawn chair
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise

I heard you had a baby, you want a New Boy in you?[Chorus][Interlude: repeat 2X]
I met a group of girls in a Escalade
I met a group of girls in a Escalade
Met a-met a group of girls in a Escalade
They came wit'chu and left with me[""me"" repeats fast after second Interlude][Chorus][Outro]

85,Headlines,Drake,2011,Drake,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/drake/headlines.html,"

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
'Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know
They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah!
I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything! Money on my mind!""
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake"", girl don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know
I be yelling out ""Money over everything!""
""Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!""
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better

What goes around comes back around, hey, my baby
What goes around comes back around, hey, my baby
I say what goes around comes back around, hey, my baby
What goes around comes back around
There was a time
I thought, that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind
So, when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I—I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
So, baby, good lookin' out
I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now
So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and, baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
Baby, good lookin' out
I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time, another world, another life
Thank God I found the good in goodbye
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Oh, best thing you never had!
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, I will never be the best thing you never had
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now
What goes around, comes back around
What goes around, comes back around
I bet it sucks to be you right now
What goes around, comes back around
I bet it sucks to be you right now
What goes around, comes back around
I bet it sucks to be you right now

Check that out, what they playing?
That's my song, that's my song
Where my drinks?
I've been waiting much too long, much too long
And this girl in my lap passing out, she's a blonde
The last thing on my mind is going home
From the window to the wall
This club is jumping 'til tomorrow
Is it daylight or is it nighttime?
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4
We gon' tear the club up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Day-o me say day-o
Daylight come, and we don't wanna go home
Yeah so we're losing control
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown
Let the club shut down
We won't go 
Burn it down
To the floor 
Day-o me say day-o
Daylight come, and we don't wanna go home
We drink the whole bottle but it ain't over over
Everybody jumping on the sofa sofa
Standing on the chairs
Standing on the bar
No matter day or night I'm shining
Bitch, I'm a star
From the window to the wall
This club is jumping 'til tomorrow
Is it daylight or is it nighttime?
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4
We gon' tear the club up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Day-o me say day-o
Daylight come, and we don't wanna go home
Yeah so we're losing control
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown
Let the club shut down
We won't go 
Burn it down
To the floor 
I said, day-o me say day-o
Daylight come, and we don't wanna go home
(let's go)
I just met this sexy Haitian girl moving like a dancer
Told her and her girlfriends, ""Let's meet in my cabana.""
Ask me where the party's at baby, I'm the answer
Have another drink with me. Shorty, where your manners?
Take another shot another shot shot shot shot
I can make it hot make it hot we gon' rock until the
Day-o me say day-o
Daylight come, and we don't wanna go home
We don't wanna go home, baby, no
Yeah so we're losing control
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown
Let the club shut down
We won't go 
Burn it down
To the floor
To the floor ba-ba-baby
Day-o me say day-o

No, not this way, but you don't understand it, girl

90,Take A Back Road,Rodney Atkins,2011,Rodney Atkins,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/rodneyatkins/takeabackroad.html,"

Sit in that six-lane backed up traffic
Horns are honking, I've about had it
I'm looking for an exit sign
Gotta get out of here, get it all off my mind
Then like a memory from your grandpa's attic
A song comes slippin' through the radio static
Changing my mood
A little George Strait 1982
And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
I've been cooped up, tied down, 'bout forgotten
What a field looks like, full of corn and cotton
If I'm gonna hit a traffic jam
Well, it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need a curve and wind-a-twistin'
Dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowing through my baby's hair
Yeah, makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road 
Maybe it's the feeling or maybe it's the freedom
Maybe it's that shady spot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot
Girl, we park the truck when the things get hot
And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab you honey 
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road, get right with my soul
Now all I gotta do is take some old back road
To the shady spot where things get hot, girl
Way down, way down, way down some old back road

Cause you're the cigarette and I'm the smoker
We raise a bet, cause you're the joker
Truth told, you are the chalk and I could be the blackboard
And you can be the talk and I could be the walk
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hands in mine
Even when we're down to the wire babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it baby simple and plain
Cause this love is a sure thing
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that, that, that
You could be the lover I'll be the fighter babe
If I'm the blunt, you could be the lighter babe, fire it up

If I'm the lyric baby you could be the note, record that
Saint, I'm a sinner, prize, I'm a winner, and it's you
What can I do to deserve that
Paper baby, I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one, cause you are ten
Real and not pretend

Rock with me babe

Those eyes; they never lie

I wanna make you spend the whole day with me boy
Play me like your toy, I'm all yours to enjoy
Hoping this moment last long and forever
I got no fear what so ever, you're my one and only lover
Roll a dice I bet it twice
Don't you think I can live a life without
You in it you can bet that
Never sweat that you know what I'm best at
Ready or not, I'm gonna have you by tonight

When the sale comes first

Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious?
Got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time[Pre-chorus:]

We do this for the love
So we fight and sacrifice
Every night
So we ain't gon' stumble and fall

Waiting to see or send a sign of defeat

Moving their feet

And then everyone sing

I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain't who I wanna be
But you stay here right beside me
And watch as the storm blows through
And I need you
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I lost my way
There are no words here left to say,
It's true
God gave me you
Gave me you
There's more here than what we're seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you—an angel lovely—
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I lost my way
There are no words here left to say,
It's true
God gave me you
On my own I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo
'Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I lost my way
There are no words here left to say,
It's true

He gave me you

Young Money[Lil Wayne:]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga.""
I already know that life is deep but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around, comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drumset
I've been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split[Drake:]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
'cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now

Yeah, I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me.""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in, and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that ""wine and dine""
Try to check me and I'mma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rocking like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of death and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face South and her ass North
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split![Drake:]

96,Are You Gonna Kiss Me Or Not,Thompson Square,2011,Thompson Square,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/thompsonsquare/areyougonnakissmeornot.html,"

We were sittin' up there on your momma's roof
Talkin' 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move
Oh, but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me
""Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're 'bout to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?""
It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand
So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me
""Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?""
So, we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle
When the preacher man said, ""Say I do""
I did and you did too, then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
""Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love that we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not?""
Yeah baby, I love you a lot
I really think we've got a shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid
You're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
You're just
A cannibal
And I'm afraid
I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
Hush, hush, the world is quiet
Hush, hush, we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Whoa, I won't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tonight
Here we go again [3x]
Oh oh

What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight

Baby, here I am again
Kicking dust in the Canyon wind
Waiting for that sun to go down
Made it up Mulholland Drive
Hell bent on getting high
High above the lights of town
'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough
Thirty days and thirty nights
Been putting up a real good fight
And there were times I thought you'd win
It's so easy to forget
The bitter taste the morning left
Swore I wouldn't go back there again
'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough
When it comes to you
Oh, the damage I could do
It's always your favorite sins
That do you in
'Cause you and Tequila make me crazy
Run like poison in my blood
One more night could kill me, baby
One is one too many, one more is never enough
Never enough
You and Tequila
You and Tequila

She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the tail lights shining through the window pane[Chorus:]
He said I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said you're ramblin' man
You ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'
At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same ol' light a-shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him[Chorus:]
He said I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said you're ramblin' man
You ain't ever gonna change
You got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin' (born for leavin')
Well, it's a winding road
When you're in the lost and found
You're a lover – I'm a runner
And we go 'round 'n 'round
And I love you but I leave you
I don't want you but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here, baby
Oh I wanna see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
Cause I'm a ramblin' man
I ain't ever gonna change (I ain't ever gonna change)
I got a gypsy soul to blame
And I was born for leavin' (born for leavin')
When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whispering pines
I'm with your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
But I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait 'til then
I can't wait 'til then

See I just walked in fresher than the shirts off in this muthafucka
I'm a, I'm a need a baddest broad to twirk off in this muthafucka
I'm a go hard till it hurts off in this muthafucka
I'm a ball so you gotta work off in this muthafucka
The work, and I can get you anything you want

See you look like Beyonce so do it like Beyon...
Do it, do it like Beyonce and put it on Sean
Grind hard but got a lot to show for it
Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it
My team's so true we should get a camera crew
To follow us around and make a show for us[Hook: Chris Brown]

And I'm a make it last, like it's my last
And I'm gone, can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan
Now she all up in space
All, all up in my face like ""you remember who I am""
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louie Vuitton shine
Up in Benny Han Han eating all the Wonton (what's good)
Rozay rose or a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John
Man I just ended up on er'body guestlist
I'm just doing better than what everyone projected
I Knew that I'd be here so if you asked me how I feel
I'm a just tell you, it's everything that I expected
Bitch!

[Gotye:]
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know[Kimbra:]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know[Gotye:]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody
(I used to know)
Somebody
(Now you're just somebody that I used to know)

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I'd trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way
Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?
It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?
Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?
And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way
I beg, and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way
Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?
It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?
Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?
And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad
It's hard to look right
At you baby

So call me, maybe?
Hey, I just met you

Give me a second I
I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise a toast
'Cause I found someone to carry me home
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
The moon is on my side (Nananananana)
I have no reason to run (Nananananana)
So will someone come and carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
The angels never arrived (Nananananana)
But I can hear the choir (Nananananana)
So will someone come and carry me home (Nananananana)
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire

All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be...
It's even harder to picture,
That you're not here next to me.
You say it's too late to make it,
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed.
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday.
I gave you my love to borrow,
But you just gave it away.
You can't expect me to be fine,
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down.
I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed.
Still stuck in that time

Yeah, yeah, now baby don't hang up,
So I can tell you what you need to know,
Baby I'm begging you just please don't go,
So I can tell you what you need to know[Explicit version verse (Wiz Khalifa):]
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing,
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunning,
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it,
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it,
Don't need my name on my shirt,
You can tell it I'm ballin.
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for.
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you.

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on, over you
You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You try to break me, but you see
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger

Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
Thanks to you I got a new thing started
Thanks to you I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking about me
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
In the end...
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more, more
'Til I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time
(Oh oh, oh oh)
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop
(We're higher than a motherfucker)
(We're higher than a motherfucker)
(We're higher than a motherfucker)
Jump in my hooptie hooptie hoop
I own that
And I ain't paying my rent this month
I owe that
But fuck who you want, and fuck who you like
That's our life, there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle little star
Now everybody let me hear you say ray ray ray
Now spend all your money cause today's pay day
And if you're a G, you a G, G, G
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time
(Oh oh, oh oh)
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop
(We're higher than a motherfucker)
(We're higher than a motherfucker)
(We're higher than a motherfucker)
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky

[Liam:]
You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need make-up
To cover up
Being the way that you are is enough[Harry:]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you[All:]
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know
Oh, oh
You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'd understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know
Oh, oh
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh, oh
That's what makes you beautiful[Zayn:]
So c-come on
You got it wrong
To prove I'm right
I put it in a song
I don't know why
You're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye-eye-eyes[Harry]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you[All:]
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell

You don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see

[Sia:]
Hey I heard you are a wild one
Ooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones 
(Wild ones wild ones)
Ooh[Flo Rida:]
I-I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping music
I might lose it
Glass to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)
I don't care the night, she don't care we like
Almost dared the right vibe
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jumping nose dive
Surfing the crowd
Ooh
Said I gotta be the man
I'm the head of my band, mic check one two
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it
And y'all get loose loose
After bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow
Gotta break rules cause that's the motto
Club shuts down, a hundred super models[Sia:]
Hey I heard you are a wild one
Ooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones 
(Wild ones wild ones)
Ooh[Flo Rida:]
Party rocker, for show stopper
More Chambull
Number-one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off
Then I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Round up baby tilt the freaky show
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, private show
I like 'em untamed, don't tell me how pain
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, call my homie then we hit Spain
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane[Sia:]
Hey I heard you are a wild one
Ooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones 
(Wild ones wild ones)
Ooh[Bridge:]
I am a wild one
Break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one
Tame me now
Running with wolves
And I'm on the prowl
I show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body
Dominate you 'til you've had enough
I hear you like the wild stuff[Sia:]
Hey I heard you are a wild one
Ooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones 
(Wild ones wild ones)
Ooh
I am a wild one
Break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one
Tame me now
Running with wolves
And I'm on the prowl

12,Set Fire To The Rain,Adele,2012,Adele,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/adele/setfiretotherain.html,"

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing is better
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!
Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh!
Oh, no
Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn

When I'm at the mall, security just can't fight them all
And when I'm at the beach, I'm in a Speedo trying to tan my cheeks (what?)
This is how I roll, come on ladies it's time to go
We headed to the bar, baby don't be nervous
No shoes, no shirt, and I still get service (watch)

14,Some Nights,fun.,2012,fun.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fun/somenights.html,"

Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Most nights I don't know anymore...
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
This is it, boys, this is war - what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style
That's alright (that's alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mmm... Mmm...
Well, some nights I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights I always win, I always win...
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Most nights I don't know... (oh, come on)
So this is it 
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Come on)
No. When I see stars, when I see 
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan, so come on
Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on!
Well, that is it guys, that is all 
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home;
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?
My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she called ""love""
When I look into my nephew's eyes...
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from...
Some terrible nights... ah...
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh,
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
The other night you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance... Oh...
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance... Oh...

43,Someone Like You,Adele,2012,Adele,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/adele/someonelikeyou.html,"

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light.
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead""
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't over.
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.""
Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes
They are memories made.
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I'll remember you said,
""Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"".
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg

Uncle is Gangnam style
Gangnam style
A girl who is warm and humanly during the day
A classy girl who knows how to enjoy the freedom of a cup of coffee
A girl whose heart gets hotter when night comes
A girl with that kind of twist
I'm a guy
A guy who is as warm as you during the day
A guy who one-shots his coffee before it even cools down
A guy whose heart bursts when night comes
That kind of guy
Beautiful, loveable
Yes you, hey, yes you, hey
Beautiful, loveable
Yes you, hey, yes you, hey

Eh sexy lady
A girl who looks quiet but plays when she plays
A girl who puts her hair down when the right time comes
A girl who covers herself but is more sexy than a girl who bares it all
A sensible girl like that
I'm a guy
A guy who seems calm but plays when he plays
A guy who goes completely crazy when the right time comes
A guy who has bulging ideas rather than muscles
That kind of guy
Beautiful, loveable
Yes you, hey, yes you, hey
Beautiful, loveable
Yes you, hey, yes you, hey

[Pitbull:]
Went from Mr. 305, Dade County, to Mr. Worldwide, all around the world[Chris Brown:] Ay ay, yeah ah!
Now we're international, so international, international, so international
You can't catch me, boy (can't catch me, boy)
I'm overseas and about a hundred G's per show
Don't test me, boy (don't test me, boy)
'Cause I rap with the best for sure
305 'til the death of me
Cremate my body and let the ocean have what's left of me
But for now forget about that
Blow the whistle
Baby, you're the referee, dalé[Chris Brown:]
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep!
Wild like Los Angeles (Chris Brown)
My fantasy!
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat!
Oh, girl, it's international love (international)
Oh, yeah, it's international love[Pitbull:]
I don't play football but I've touched down everywhere
Everywhere? Everywhere!
I don't play baseball but I've hit a home run everywhere, everywhere
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed
In Romania she pulled me to the side and told me
""Pit, you can have me and my sister.""
In Lebanon, yeah, the women are bomb
And in Greece—you've guessed it—the women are sweet
Been all around the world but I ain't gon' lie—
There's nothing like Miami's heat[Chris Brown:]
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep!
Wild like Los Angeles (A-ha)
My fantasy!
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat!
Oh, girl, it's international love (international, that'r right)
Oh, yeah, it's international love[Pitbull:]
Down in D.R. they're looking for visas
I ain't talking credit cards if you know what I mean!
En Cuba, la cosa esta dura!
But the woman get down, if you know what I mean!
In Colombia the women got everything done
But they are some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil they're freaky with big old boobs
And their thongs, blue yellow and green!
In L.A. tengo la Mexicana
En New York tengo la boricua
Besito para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah!
Y en Miami tengo a cualquiera![Chris Brown:]
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep!
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy!
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat!
Oh (all around the world), it's international love (international)
Oh, yeah, it's international love[Chris Brown:]
There's not a place that your love don't affect me, baby
So don't ever change
I'll cross the globe when I'm with you, baby
Hey, whoa-oh[Pitbull:]
Chris Brown, this is for the women worldwide
Let's rap[Chris Brown:]
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep!
Wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy!
Hotter than Miami
I feel the heat! (305)
Oh, yeah, it's international love (international, that's right)
Oh, yeah, it's international love[Chris Brown:]
You put it down like New York City

You are international, so international
You're international, so international
You are international, so international
International love

Hold on to me as we go
As we roll down this unfamiliar road
And although this wave, wave is stringing us along
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home
Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble - it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home
Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble - it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home
Come on

I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game
Without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you
I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by
Without you, without you
I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I
Without you, without you
Oh oh oh!
You! You! You!
Without...
You! You! You!
Without... you
I can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged
Without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you, without you
I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed
Without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind
Without you, without you
Oh oh oh!
You! You! You!
Without...
You! You! You!
Without... you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you
Without... you

51,Ass Back Home,Gym Class Heroes Featuring Neon Hitch,2012,Gym Class Heroes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gymclassheroes/assbackhome.html,"

[Travie McCoy:]
Oh, it's so sexy, yo[Neon Hitch:]
I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
(...Travie. Gym Class Heroes.)
I don't know, where you're going
(Let's go)
Just get your ass back home[Travie McCoy:]
We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets downright shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke
I told you I wouldn't be long,
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
For one more chance to hold you close
(OK)
I don't know, where you're going
(What's next?)
Just get your ass back home[Travie McCoy:]
And you've been nothing but amazing
And I never take that for granted
Half of these birds would have flew the coop
But you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me,
Every time you heard some bogusness
You deserve a standing o 'cause they'd a just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that
Just let them wallow in it
Now they all choked up, yuck
'Cause they be swallowing it
I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
(alright)
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
(I'm coming home, mama)
(mama, I'm coming home)
(That's right)
For one more chance to hold you close
(can't wait to get home)
I don't know, where you're going
Just get your ass back home
No one holds me down like you do, sweetheart
You keep doing that, I keep doing this
We'll be alright in the end
Trust that
We put the us in trust, baby
Aw, let's go
I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone
I don't know, where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door
(I'm home now, baby.)
(let's go)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know, where you're going
(what's next)
Just get your ass back home.
I'm home, baby.

52,Wanted,Hunter Hayes,2012,Hunter Hayes,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hunterhayes/wanted.html,"

You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl, I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too
'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted
Anyone can tell you you're pretty, yeah
And you get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the make-up
And I wanna show you what I see tonight...
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips.
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause, baby, I wanna make you feel wanted
As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted
Baby, I wanna make you feel wanted
You'll always be wanted

Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, 4 wheel drives
In a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party started[Chorus:]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
If you ain't a 10 you're a 9.9
Tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good god almighty[Chorus:]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water[Chorus:]
Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
Yeah, I'm a little drunk on you

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smoking on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, Bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he's, not I, I smoke strong, that Popeye
Louie V's in my archives, black diamonds, apartheid
Bread up and my top down
On the block with a block out
Hit ya ass with that block out
Dope enough to go in yo nostrils
I'll take ya girl and kid nap her
Feed her to my mattress
The skeleton in my closet
It's probably dead ass rappers
It's probably pussy ass niggas
Don't try me I pull that trigga
Got ya car note in my cup
And your rent in my swisha
That pussy so good I miss ya
Head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese
Like I'm taking pictures[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, 'less I'm with' ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya

2 Chainz and champagne
You want true, that's true enough
Forbes list like every year
My office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food
She got fucked, she knew wassup
She think I'm the realest out
And I say ""damn, that makes two of us""
Oh that look like what's her name
Chances are there's what's her name
Chances are, if she was acting up
Then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time it's fine with me
Young as an intern, with money like I built the shit
Streets talking that confirm
Go ask them who just catch shit
Stay keeping my cup full so I'm extra charged like a state tax
Me an' Chainz go way back
We don't talk shit, we just say facts (Yes Lord)[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, 'less I'm with' ya

Name a nigga that want some

Went where they say I couldn't (true)

We used to be, but now there's a separation between you and me
Baby I'm moving on to another girl that understands me more
Dated her in front your place so you can see it all
I remember the times, when we used to bond
But I never realized that you wanted to be mine
So I gave her the ring, instead of you, nickname too
I can tell that you're upset, because it ain't you
Met a new girl, and I gave her my heart
Not noticing that you wanted me from the very start
You want me back?
We can just be friends, don't try this thing all over again
Come on

To this day when I hear that song,
I see you standing there on that lawn
Discount shades, store-bought tan,
Flip-flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun,
""I'm On Fire"" and ""Born To Run""
You looked at me and I was done,
And we, we're just getting started
I was singing to you, you were singing to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang oh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound
Of you saying, ""Don't go.""
When I think about you
I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name,
I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
'Bout your name on my arm
Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night on your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born In The USA
You relive those glory days so long ago
When you think about me
Do you think about 17
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen, Springsteen
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen, Springsteen, oh, Springsteen

This is more than the typical kinda thing
Felt the jones in my bones when you were touching me, uh oh
Didn't wanna take it slow
In a daze, going crazy, I can barely think
You're replaying in my brain, find it hard to sleep, uh oh
Waiting for my phone to blow
Uh oh yep
Now I'm here in a sticky situation
Got a little trouble, yep and now I'm pacing
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour
Uh don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour
Uh oh, I can't seem to let you go
See, I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest baby, I'll do anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio
What's the time, such a crime
Not a single word, sipping on that Patrón
Just to calm my nerves, uh oh
Poppin' bottles by the phone
Oh yeah
Had me up, had me down, turn me inside out
That's enough, call me up
Baby I'm in doubt, oh oh
I don't even think you know, no no
See, I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest baby, I'll do anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio
Anything you wanna do, I'll be on it too
Everything you said is like gold with the view
Business in the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack?
This kinda thing doesn't happen usually
I'm on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it so come and get it, cheerio
See, I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight, ohhhohohhhoohhhh
Honest baby, I'll do anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheeri, cheerio
When you gonna call
Don't leave me brokenhearted
I've been waiting up
Let's finish what we started, oh oh
I can't seem to let you go
Come on, that's right, cheerio, uh!

60,Not Over You,Gavin DeGraw,2012,Gavin DeGraw,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brettyoung/notoveryou.html,"

Dreams, that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm not over you
Not over you
Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
You took this heart and you put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
And I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm not over you
And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then...
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm not over you
Not over you
Not over you
Not over you
Not over you

[Adam Levine:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo[Travie McCoy:]
Gym Class Heroes baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yea [scratched], check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to used to used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you[Adam Levine:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo[Travie McCoy:]
Let's go!
If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox (remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops (turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop?
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mix tape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you[Adam Levine:]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh so sing along to my stereo
I only pray you never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine (yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-o-te
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh (it's your boy Travis!) oh oh oh (Gym Class Heroes baby!) so sing along to my stereo
Yeah

Let's excuse me baby
Go, yeah you baby
Back, ooh you groovy baby
In, let's make a movie baby
Time, excuse me baby
Let's, yeah you baby
Go, ooh you groovy baby
Back in, let's make a movie baby
Time
It's Mr Worldwide, Agent A, Reporting live
From Cape Canaveral, MK, Big Syphe, let's ride
Back, back, in, in, time
Baby, ohhh baby
Ohhh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one
Miami equals black mask, black clothes
With a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K, and I wish the whole world would
Ok, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
I’m a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture, bury a boarder, record-breaker won’t cha
Give credit where credit is due don’t cha
Know that I don't give a number two
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future we have to go back in time
Baby, ohhh baby
Ohhh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one
I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
Let’s save the world
Men In Black I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to
What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I’d bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future, we have to go back in time
Baby, ohhh baby
Ohhh baby, my sweet baby
You're the one
Let's excuse me baby
Go, yeah you baby

I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me.
Hey, we got a good thing.
Don't know if I'mma see you again.
But is that a good thing?
'Cause, girl, I can't be your man.
No, ma'am.
I know what's on your brain.
You're probably hope it never would end.
Like is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?
Well, then...
Let me see you get high and go low.
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I'm here for one night. How far will you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me.
High and go low.
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I'm here for one night. How far will you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me.
She like them boys with the big old chains
Ride around town in the big old Range.
I knew her when I rock big old chains.
Now the little nigga doing big old things.
Would you look at that? I came back for it
Just to give it to you like you aksed for it.
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for it.
It rebounds, so, I caught off the backboard.
I told her, ""Baby girl, come here.
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.
And I brag hardly,
but just to show up at this party
I made what your nigga make in one year.
that's unfair.""
but so is life: take a chance, roll a dice.
Money can't buy you love 'cause it's over-priced.
Don't over-think, just hope it's right.
I'm only here for the night.
Hey, we got a good thing.
Don't know if I'mma see you again.
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl I can't be your man.
no, ma'am.
I know what's on your brain.
You probably hope it never would end.
Like is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?

High and go low.
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I'm here for one night. How far will you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me.
Carolina blue kicks fresh on the scene.
Hottest nigga on the block. Damn, girl, you're mean.
They be starting shit, but it's your world.
On my Martin shit you go, girl.
She bad and she know it. Some niggas save hoes.
I'm not that heroic.
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two-door Fords.
Damn, they don't make 'em like you no more.
Cole World, real Cole World.
Them boys cool. Me. I'm on fire.
Know what's on my mind.
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight.
Move slow 'cause you wanna live fast.
Up late, so, you'll probably skip class.
Life is a test.
so before the night pass
get right get right.
Hey, we got a good thing.
Don't know if I'mma see you again.
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl I can't be your man.
no, ma'am.
I know what's on your brain.
You probably hope it never would end.
Like is it the real thing
or is just a one-night stand?
Well, then...
Cole World.
Straight up. Now tell me do you really wanna love me forever—
Oh, oh, oh—
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
Well, hey.
Straight up. I tell you I just really wanna cut when we're together.
Oh, oh, oh.
Come here, girl, let's get it on.
Work out for me, work out for me.
Straight up. Now tell me do you really wanna love me forever—
Oh, oh, oh—

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want?
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore
Rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?
(Bless your soul!)
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for
Rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it
Rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)
But rumour has it (rumour)

Go and throw away the key

You got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding
And a hand you can hold

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

95,Hard To Love,Lee Brice,2012,Lee Brice,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leebrice/hardtolove.html,"

I am insensitive, I have a tendency
To pay more attention to the things that I need.
Sometimes I drink too much, sometimes I test your trust,
Sometimes I don't know why you stay with me.
I'm hard to love, hard to love,
No, I don't make it easy,
Well, I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood.
I'm hard to love, hard to love,
And you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good.
I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
And I wish that I could be more like you.
I'm hard to love, hard to love,
No, I don't make it easy,
Well, I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood,
I'm hard to love, hard to love,
And you say that you need me,
Well, I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good.
Love me good.
Girl, you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted,
I'm just a man, I'm just a man
Hard to love, hard to love,
Oh, I don't make it easy
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood.
I'm hard to love, hard to love
And you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good,
You love me good.
Hard to love, hard to love,
Oh, I don't make it easy
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood.
I'm hard to love, hard to love
And you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good,
You love me good.
You love me good.

Somethin bout a truck in a farmers field
A no trespass sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal
Somethin bout a truck in a farmer's field
Somethin bout beer, sittin on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate, on a summer night
Somethin bout beer sittin on ice
And there's somethin bout a girl in a red sun dress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmers field, will make a boy a mess
There's somethin bout a girl in a red sundress
And there's somethin bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
And there's somethin bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips beggin for another kiss
And there's somethin bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin bout it luck,
There's somethin bout a truck
Somethin bout a creek, around 2 a.m.
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang em on a limb
There's somethin bout a creek around 2 a.m.
And there's somethin bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Beggin for another kiss
And there's somethin bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothin bout it luck, there's somethin bout a truck
Ain't nothin bout it luck, there's somethin bout a truck

98,Fly Over States,Jason Aldean,2012,Jason Aldean,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jasonaldean/flyoverstates.html,"

A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killin' time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?
They've never drove through Indiana
Met the man who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those fly over states
I bet that mile long Santa Fe
Freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy
Stacking US Steel on a three day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah, that sounds like a first class seat
On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water colored painted sky
You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those fly over states
Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
Meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those fly over states
Have you ever been through Indiana
On the plains of Oklahoma
Take a ride

99,Even If It Breaks Your Heart,Eli Young Band,2012,Eli Young Band,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eliyoungband/evenifitbreaksyourheart.html,"

Way back on the radio dial,
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child.
Every note just wrapped around his soul,
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll.
Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'.
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar.
Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin',
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart.""
Downtown is where I used to wander.
Old enough to get there but too young to get inside.
So I would stand out on the sidewalk,
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night.
Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'.
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar.
Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin',
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart.""
Some dreams stay with you forever,
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were.
Some dreams keep on gettin' better,
Gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure.
Ohhh, I can hear 'em playin'.
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar.
Ohhh, I can hear 'em singin',
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart.""[x2]
Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart.
Keep on dreamin' 
Don't let it break your heart.

100,Burn It Down,Linkin Park,2012,Linkin Park,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/linkinpark/burnitdown.html,"

The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground
You told me, ""Yes,""
You held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring
You lost that right, to hold that crown
I built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know
We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

Hey, Macklemore! Can we go thrift shopping?
What, what, what, what... [8x]
Bada, bada, badadada [8x]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I - I - I'm hunting, looking for a come-up
This is fucking awesome
Nah, walk up to the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock!""
I'm so pumped about some shit from the thrift shop
Ice on the fringe, it's so damn frosty
That people like, ""Damn! That's a cold ass honkey.""
Rollin' in, hella deep, headin' to the mezzanine,
Dressed in all pink, 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girls standin' next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets
Piiisssssss
But—shit—it was ninety-nine cents! Bag it
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else's been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man
I am stuntin' and flossin' and
Savin' my money and I'm hella happy that's a bargain, bitch
I'm a take your grandpa's style, I'm a take your grandpa's style,
No, for real. Ask your grandpa. Can I have his hand-me-downs? Thank you
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a kneeboard
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like ""Aw, he got the Velcros""[2x]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I - I - I'm hunting, looking for a come-up
This is fucking awesome
What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come-up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button-up shirt
'Cause right now I'm up in her skirt
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the Uptons
I'm not, I'm not stuck, I'm searchin' in that section Uptons
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, second-hand, I rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci. That's hella tight.""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt.""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt - that's just some ignorant bitch. Shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped. Shit
I call that getting tricked by a business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand and you hella won't
Man you hella won't
Goodwill... poppin' tags... yeah!

Only got twenty dollars in my pocket

From that thrift shop down the road. Let's go

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
The way that things have been oh, ooh-ooh
The way that things have been oh, ooh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache, from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
(Pain!)
When everything, everything you touch
Turns to gold, gold, gold
When everything, everything (You make me a, you make a believer) everything you touch
Turns to gold (believer) gold
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all (after all)
This city never sleeps tonight
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
In the meantime we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side we used to show
In the moonlight we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away

I'm on top of the world (Hey!)
Been waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile (Hey!)
Been holding it in for a while (Hey!)
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You've gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You've gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
('Cause I'm a bad liar)
I've bet my life
(You make me a, you make me a believer)
I've bet my life for you
Feel the thunder
And the lightning

Return of the Mack, get up!
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't.
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me.
Get up! Thrift shop, pimp-strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater game, nope, nope y'all can't copy
Yup. Bad, moon-walking, this here is our party, my posse's been on Broadway,
And we did it our way.
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on...
Let that stage light go and shine on down,
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style.
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds,
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustling,
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen with the four track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crush shit.
Labels out here,
Nah, they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people,
Spread it across the country
Labels out here,
Nah, they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people,
Spread it across the country
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over

Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Nah, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful.
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me, go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you give a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome,
Caesar'll make you a believer.
Nah I never ever did it for a throne.
That validation comes from giving it back to the people.
Nah sing this song and it goes like
""Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching""
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me.
Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching. I said...
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you somethin', an original
'Cause it doesn't seem merely a sample
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I would look at us all the time
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now

And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now (please show me, baby)
I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
You are, you are the love of my life [10x]
Now you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are
You are, you are the love of my life [8x]
Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You are, you are the love of my life [16x]

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like oooooh…
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, ohh…
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like oooooh…
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should've gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin’ right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs!""
Couldn’t help myself so I walked up and said
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
She was sippin’ on Southern and singin’ Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said,
""Fire it up, let’s go get this thing stuck.""
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin’
Hell, I can’t get you out of my head
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin’ stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
Come on
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aww, yeah.

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly
Agree politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up (Hey!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger
A fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero
You held me down, but I got up (Hey!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

All along it was a fever
A cold-sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, ""Show me something.""
He said, ""If you dare, come a little closer.""
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay
Ooh, ooh, ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light it's hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, ooh

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy
My friends and I—we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece

And I'm in love with being queen
Ooh ooh oh
Life is great without a care

[Music video spoken part:]
I think - I think when it's all over,
It just comes back in flashes, you know?
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
It just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did,
It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
It was losing me.
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies. He'll never see you cry,
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me[2x]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize[2x]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)

Wait a minute. You ready, JT?[Justin Timberlake:]
I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-looking
Going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And ow burned myself, but just had to touch it
But it's so fine and it's all mine
Hey, baby, we don't mind all the watching, ha
'Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fire tonight[Justin Timberlake:]
And as long as I got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things

Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love[Justin Timberlake:]
Stop, let me get a good look at it
Oh, so thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
And aw, shit's so sick, got a hit and picked up a habit
But that's alright, 'cause you're all mine
Aw, go on and show 'em who you call ""daddy""
I guess they're just mad 'cause, girl, they wish they had it
Ooh, my killer, my thriller, yeah, you're a classic

All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban links
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about?
I'm at the restaurant
My rant disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some make-up sex
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All Saints for my angel
Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'usses on doubles
ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her 'cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, huh, uh![Justin Timberlake:]
And as long as I got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight

Show you a few things about love, love, love
Let me show you a few things

I've got my ticket for the long way 'round

You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it
I still don't know why, why our love is so much, ohh
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you

Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin', but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice; that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder

Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store

Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body, curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller[Justin Timberlake:]

You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed

And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name

High dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash 'cause we both know how this ends
A clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again
'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?
(Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey)
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?
Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave 'cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull then I'll push too deep and I'll fall right back to you
'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why
If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?
(Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey-ay-ay. Hey-ay, hey)

There was a time
I used to look into my father's eyes.
In a happy home
I was a king, I had a golden throne.
Those days are gone,
Now the memory's on the wall.
I hear the songs
From the places where I was born.
Upon a hill across a blue lake,
That's where I had my first heartbreak.
I still remember how it all changed.
My father said,
""Don't you worry, don't you worry, child.
See heaven's got a plan for you.
Don't you worry, don't you worry now.""
Yeah!
""Don't you worry, don't you worry, child.
See heaven's got a plan for you.
Don't you worry, don't you worry now.""
Yeah!
There was a time
I met a girl of a different kind.
We ruled the world,
I thought I'd never lose her out of sight.
We were so young,
I think of her now and then.
I still hear the songs
Reminding me of a friend.
Upon a hill across a blue lake,
That's where I had my first heartbreak.
I still remember how it all changed.
My father said,
""Don't you worry, don't you worry, child.
See heaven's got a plan for you.
Don't you worry, don't you worry now.""

Said your bed be feeling lonely,
So you're sleeping in mine.
Come and watch a movie with me,

So don't you worry, baby, you got me

Started
Zombie on the track
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here

Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fuckin' here
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, ""Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back""
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
'Cause we—
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame
'Cause we—
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here

I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your high love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
I want your high love and emotion endlessly
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on, baby [repeat]

Here I am waiting
I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?
This is our last night but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake, I will have to slip away
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Here I am staring
At your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright,
The stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down
This is way too hard, 'cause I know
When the sun comes up I will leave
This is my last glance that will soon be a memory
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
I never want it to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over
Start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want
All that I want, all that I want
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close

Ask for money
And get advice.
Ask for advice,
Get money twice.
I'm from the dirty
But that chico nice.
Y'all call it a moment.
I call it life.[Christina Aguilera:]
One day while my light
Is glowin',
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open,
I just want to
Feel this moment
Whoa, whoa oh oh
I just want to
Feel this moment
Whoa, whoa oh oh
I just want to
Feel this moment[Pitbull:]
Mr. worldwide...
Christina aguilera...
Oye mamita... (come on)
Dale que la cosa esta rica.[Christina Aguilera:]
I just want to feel this moment[Pitbull:]
Whoo!...
Yeah!...
Feel this moment.
Reporting live
From the tallest building in tokyo
Long way from them hard ways
Filled with zoes and oyes
Dade county always
3 0 5 all day
Now, baby, we can parley
Or, baby, we can party, ha
She read books, especially
About red rooms and tie-ups
I got her hooked
'Cause she see me in a suit
With the red tie tied up
Meet and greets,
Nice to meet ya
But time is money
Only difference is I own it
Now let's stop time
And enjoy this moment,[Christina Aguilera:]
One day while my light
Is glowin',
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open,
I just want to
Feel this moment
Whoa, whoa oh oh[Pitbull:] Come on![Christina Aguilera:]
I just want to
Feel this moment
Whoa, whoa oh oh[Pitbull:] Ha! yeah![Christina Aguilera:]
I just want to feel
This moment[Pitbull:]
Whoo!...
Ha! yeah!...
Come on!
Feel this moment.
I see the future
But live for the moment
Makes sense, don't it? ha
Now make dollars,
I mean billions
I'm a genius,
I mean brilliant
The streets are what schooled
Him and made him slicker
Than slick rick the ruler
I've lost a lot
And learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated
Like shula
I'm far from cheap (ha-ha)
I break down companies with
All my peeps (that's right)
Baby, we can travel the world
And I can give you
And all you can see
Time is money
Only difference is I own it
Like a stopwatch,
Let's stop time
And enjoy this moment...[Christina Aguilera:]
One day while my light
Is glowin',
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open,
I just want to
Feel this moment
Whoa, whoa oh oh[Pitbull:] Come on![Christina Aguilera:]
I just want to
Feel this moment
Oh, oh oh oh
I just want to feel
This moment[Pitbull:]
Whoo!...

I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, ""Is it right or is it wrong?""
If only fame had an I.V., baby could I bear
Being away from you, I found the vein, put it in here
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (make it real loud)

I've overheard your theory ""nostalgia's for geeks""
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture in me

I live for the applause-plause
Live for the applause-plause

The applause, applause, applause

You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the door

You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more
Yeah, but baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head, let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body, like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid, crawling back to you
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
Try to tell you ""no"" but my body keeps on telling you ""yes""
Try to tell you ""stop"", but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied but guilty as hell

Swagger so mean, it might insult you.
Ha, I'm like an ultra vulture.
I fuck around and catapult ya.
Torch ya, thought ya
parents taught ya.
You guys is chocha, I'm gone.
Buenos Noches.
Flow, scorch ya.
And I don't even write.
No, author.
So, harder.
So, smarter.
All about a dollar,
like 4, quarters.
Oh, father.
Will tonight be my last?
And if so, make sure my kids see my cash,
and I know, I'm solid like an elbow cast.
And my future will be better than my past. Weezy!
You could love me or hate me,
I swear it won't make me or break me.
I'm goin where ever the money take me,
until they funeral and wake me, and don't wake me.
Cause I'm sleepin', I'm dreamin',
I know that there's a better way cause I've seen it, lord,
but this faster money is so convenient.
And I need it, say I need it.
C.A.R.-T.E.R
I spit movies like a VCR.
I spit rounds like the Tiki bar.
And if I got beef, I'm the meat cleav-AR.
And I are, the illest nigger Martin Luther King died for,
and I ride for.
Holly Grove one seven Eagle street,
and I'm higher than the eagle's feet,
but I believe in me.
Apple is the car street.
I am just an offspring.
Born in the ghetto, that's why I can't let go.
One call will have my dawgs on ya like an echo.
Baby, I am the real deal, no pickle.
Spit sickle-cell psycho.
I go, off like a mother-fucker rifle.
And I'm from the underground baby like a pipe mole.
And I will stand tall like light poles until the light blows.
You could love me or hate me,
I swear it won't make me or break me.
I'm goin where ever the money take me,
until they funeral and wake me, and don't wake me.
Cause I'm sleepin', I'm dreamin',
See I'm just hustlin', living what I believe in dawg,
and it's a problem when our homies not eatin',
And I'm greedy, I'm greedy.
Share my blood, feed my family,
my flow will have to plead insanity.
So sick, I need grey's anatomy.
Acid, like a bust-open battery.
I'm cool like LA nights,
I'm tight like ballet tights.
Ay Juelz, I swear the other day I pissed Crystal.
These bitches tryna kick it like Jun Tao.
I gotta watch my head in a battle,
I'm just tryna stay ahead of my shadow.
And I'm floating like a boat and a paddle.
Alligators and rattlesnakes,
but I promised I would take a nigger off like a Saturday.
Got money to validate.
I'm icy like carrot cake.
Different color diamonds make me look like a salad plate.
I'm straight out the alley way,
it's the nigger you daddy hate.
Weezy F baby, great!
I know they love me, they hate me,
But I'm a G, it won't make me or break me.
And you could find me where ever the money place me,
until you ridin' to the late me, and don't wake me.
Cause I'm sleepin', I'm dreamin',
And me and my lord got an agreement, y'all.
And so I thank him every day for my achievements.
And I'm Weezy, I'm Weezy.

[Macklemore:]
When I was in the third grade I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like ""Ben you've loved girls since before Pre-K, trippin'""
Yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
Bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex
Had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know[Mary Lambert:]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love
My love
My love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm[Macklemore:]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it
(I don't know)[Mary Lambert:]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love
My love
My love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm[Macklemore:]
We press play, don't press pause
Progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes
We turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law is gonna change us
We have to change us
Whatever God you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear
Underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up[Mary Lambert:]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love
My love
My love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
Love is patient
Love is kind
Love is patient
Love is kind
(Not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient
(Not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind

Love is patient
(Not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind
(I'm not crying on Sundays)

Love is patient

44,Sweet Nothing,Calvin Harris Featuring Florence Welch,2013,Calvin Harris,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/calvinharris/sweetnothing.html,"

You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst,
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing[Beat break]
It isn't easy for me to let it go
Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing[Beat break]
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Nothing[Beat break]
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet nothing

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore
(1, 2, 3, 4)
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive (drive, drive)
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Kiss me hard before you go

Hold on to me as we go
As we roll down this unfamiliar road
And although this wave, wave is stringing us along
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home
Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble - it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home
Settle down, it'll all be clear
Don't pay no mind to the demons
They fill you with fear
The trouble - it might drag you down
If you get lost, you can always be found
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make this place your home
Come on

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain-check
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain-check
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[J. Cole:]
Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night[J. Cole:]
Okay, back when I was sleepin' in my mama's crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin' seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for you, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for you
Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd, Totally Krossed Out
Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you
I'm saying...[Miguel & J. Cole:]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
She got me
And we are, we are, we are
She got me[J. Cole:]
Well this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like ""Give me 20 dollars, dollars.""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yellin', ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever
But...[Miguel & J. Cole:]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
She got me
And we are, we are, we are

Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs

She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away
Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire
Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say
Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down
This girl is on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire (Oh)
Everybody stands, as she goes by
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby
This girl is on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I'd have a heart attack
Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""Yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you make me so nervous
That I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up
Won't let it show
So I'm
Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous
That I just can't hold your hand
You make me glow
But I cover up
Won't let it show
So I'm
Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
The feelings got lost in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb
And there's no one else to blame (no one else)
So scared I take off and I run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I burst into flames
You make me glow
But I cover up
Won't let it show
So I'm
Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack (heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack (-tack)

I know your insides are feeling so hollow
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half-way there
But you can take me all the way, you can take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I'll think about you every single day
I know we're only half-way there
But you can take me all the way, you can take me all the way
You're such a hard act for me to follow
Love me today, don't leave me tomorrow

If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

Wait for now
And I'll kneel down,
Know my ground
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
So break my step
And relent
Well, you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way shake the excess
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind freed from the lies
And I'll kneel down,
Wait for now
I'll kneel down,
Know my ground
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow
'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Carolina
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey momma rock me
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey momma rock me
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a-heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Oh, rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey, hey momma rock me
Oh, so rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel (I wanna feel)

I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love
I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love
Am I dreaming? Will I ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me do you feel the same
Hold me in your arms again
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love
All the years
All the times
You have never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears
All the lies
All the waste
I've been trying to make a change
And now my eyes are open
I need your love
I need your time
When everything's wrong
You make it right
I feel so high
I come alive
I need to be free

58,Some Nights,fun.,2013,fun.,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fun/somenights.html,"

Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for oh
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Most nights I don't know anymore...
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
This is it, boys, this is war - what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style
That's alright (that's alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mmm... Mmm...
Well, some nights I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights I always win, I always win...
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Whoa oh oh (What do I stand for?)
Most nights I don't know... (oh, come on)
So this is it 
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Come on)
No. When I see stars, when I see 
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan, so come on
Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on!
Well, that is it guys, that is all 
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home;
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?
My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she called ""love""
When I look into my nephew's eyes...
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things that can come from...
Some terrible nights... ah...
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh,
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, whoa, oh, oh
The other night you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance... Oh...
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance... Oh...

And Rihanna got these women in their River Island's

You got the coldest corazon, but warmest  skin
You froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero I be Scorpion

Red red red red red red red red redneck
Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ole Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At a honky-tonk
Where their boots stomp
All night
What? (That's right)
Yeah, and what they call work, digging in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
In your 4-wheel drive
(A country boy can survive)
Yeah the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice-cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit,
Don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie

No, I'm not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here yep, they still love me
Yeah, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that ""y'all""

When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help.
I'll shut down the city lights,
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe
To make you well, to make you well.
When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help.
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well.
Give me reasons to believe
That you would do the same for me.
And I would do it for you, for you.
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone.
For you, for you.
You will never sleep alone.
I'll love you long after you're gone
And long after you're gone, gone, gone.
When you fall like a statue
I'm gon' be there to catch you
Put you on your feet, you on your feet.
And if your well is empty
Not a thing will prevent me.
Tell me what you need, what do you need?
I surrender honestly.
You've always done the same for me.
So I would do it for you, for you.
Baby, I'm not moving on,
I'll love you long after you're gone.
For you, for you.
You will never sleep alone.
I'll love you long after you're gone
And long after you're gone, gone, gone.
You're my back bone.
You're my cornerstone.
You're my crutch when my legs stop moving.
You're my head start.
You're my rugged heart.
You're the pulse that I've always needed.
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.
Like a drum my heart never stops beating...
For you, for you.
Baby, I'm not moving on.
I'll love you long after you're gone.
For you, for you.
You will never sleep alone.
I'll love you long after you're gone.
For you, for you.
Baby, I'm not moving on,
I'll love you long after you're gone.
For you, for you.
You will never sleep alone.
I'll love you long, long after you're gone.
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.
Like a drum my heart never stops beating for you.
And long after you're gone, gone, gone.
I'll love you long after you're gone, gone, gone.

When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call
It's the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made
Don't wanna let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars
I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Every thing that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be—we'll be counting stars
I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
And I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Every thing that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be—we'll be counting stars
Oh, take that money watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned
Take that money watch it burn

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
I know you wanna get behind the wheel but only one Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to japan quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better but the killer was a coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a lemon here
Put you in the box just as poisonous as a cigarette
Send my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not oppressive
Oh no I can't stop I was destined
I know
Caught in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go, go, go, go
I know
Caught in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get depressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get in the car just a little visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Rihanna kiss you blessed just kill critics
Bugatti never mean I'm rich, just God fearing
Look at me steering, got no boss staring
Got a good feeling
Mr Mike Caren, tell his Billie Jeans
I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanish
No cheers, I know you wouldn't panic
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go, go, go, go
I know
Caught in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go[x4:]
When I need a healing
I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down
I know it's all better now
I know, I know, I know, I know, I, I, I, I think of letting go, go, go, go
I know
Caught in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
Caught in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go

Hey! Hey! Hey!
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Hey! Hey! Hey!
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love.
Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Hey!
Don't listen to a word I say
Hey!
The screams all sound the same
Hey!
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Hey!
Hey!
You're gone, gone, gone away
I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you.
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart,
There's nothing we can do
Just let me go we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me
Please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep
Hey!
Don't listen to a word I say
Hey!
The screams all sound the same
Hey!
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Don't listen to a word I say
Hey!
The screams all sound the same
Hey!

In the beginning
I never thought it would be you
When we were chilling
Smiling in the photo booth
But we got closer
Soon you were eating off my spoon
You're coming over
And we would talk all afternoon
Tonight we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, ""We're going all the way.""
Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes and I know
We ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sure
So tonight
Kiss me like it's do-or-die
And take me to the other side
This could be perfect
But we won't know unless we try (try)
I know you're nervous
So just sit back and let me drive
Tonight we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, ""We're going all the way.""
Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes and I know
We ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sure
So tonight
Kiss me like it's do-or-die
And take me to the other side
Kiss me like it's do-or-die
And take me to the other side
Tonight we'll just get drunk
Disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip
Whisper and say, ""We're going all the way.""
Tonight
Take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
(Blasting through the air)
Just take me to the other side
(Take me, baby)
I see that sexy look in your eyes and I know
We ain't friends anymore
(oh, no)
If we walk down this road
We'll be lovers for sure
So tonight (so tonight)
Kiss me like it's do-or-die

And take me to the other side
Take me to the other side
And take me to the other side
Kiss me like it's do-or-die
And take me to the other side

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-ag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bitch, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berzerk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk), shake your body
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khaki's pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced, so I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But, girl, your body's banging, jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree, 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, Baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowing up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowing it down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
Least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now hoe
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berzerk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk) shake your body
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough Codeine to knock future into tomorrow
And, girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am trying to find a way to get you alone (car note)
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shit head with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangols and car-heart-less cargos
Girl, you're fixing to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick, word, man, you heard, but don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berzerk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berzerk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk), shake your body
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk) shake your body

68,Catch My Breath,Kelly Clarkson,2013,Kelly Clarkson,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kellyclarkson/catchmybreath.html,"

I don't wanna be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life
Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catch my breath, no one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath, won't let them get me down
It's all so simple now
Addicted to the love I found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, karma comes around
I will spend the rest of my life
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catch my breath, no one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath, won't let them get me down
It's all so simple now
You helped me see
The beauty in everything
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catch my breath
Catch my breath, no one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath, won't let them get me down
It's all so simple now
It's all so simple now
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
(Catch my breath)
Catch my breath, no one can hold me back
I ain't got time for that
(Catch my breath)
Catch my breath (catch my breath), won't let them get me down
It's all so simple now

69,Crash My Party,Luke Bryan,2013,Luke Bryan,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lukebryan/crashmyparty.html,"

It don’t matter what plans I got, I can break ‘em.
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don’t mind telling all the guys I can’t meet ‘em.
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night
Girl, I don’t care. Oh I just gotta see what you’re wearing.
Your hair, is it pulled up or falling down?
Oh I just have to see it now.[Chorus:]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me.
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night;
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I'll pour you a drink.
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime.
Ain’t a spot downtown that’s rockin’ the way that you rock me.
Ain’t a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do.
I could be on the front row of the best show.
And look down and see your face on my phone.
And I’m gone so long, hang on. I’ll meet you in a minute or two.[Chorus]
If it’s 2 in the morning
And you’re feeling lonely
And wondering what I’m doing...[Chorus:]
Go ahead and call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night;
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I'll pour you a drink.
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime.
(Call me, call me, call me)
Baby you can crash my party anytime.

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.
Yeah,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time
Uh oh!
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh
It seems like one of those nights,
This place is too crowded.
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)
It seems like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping.
Yeah,
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks

I'm booking myself a one-way flight
I gotta see the color in your eyes
Yeah, tellin' myself I'm gonna be alright
Without you, baby, is a waste of time
Yeah, our first date, girl, the seasons changed
It got washed away in a summer rain
You can't undo a fall like this
'Cause love don't know what distance is
Yeah, I know it's crazy
But I don't want ""good"" and I don't want ""good enough""
I want ""can't sleep, can't breathe without your love""
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right
If you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy
I want crazy
You with me, baby?
Let's be crazy
I wanna be scared. Don't wanna know why
Wanna feel good. Don't have to be right
The world makes all kinds of rules for love
I say you gotta let it do what it does
I don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight
Catchin' up calls and a date sometimes
I love that we're rebels, and we still believe
We're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be
And I know we're crazy, yeah
But I don't want ""good"" and I don't want ""good enough""
I want ""can't sleep, can't breathe without your love""

If you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy
I want crazy
Yeah, look at us, baby
Tonight the midnight rules are breaking
There's no such thing as wild enough
And maybe we just think too much
Who needs to play it safe in love?
Let's be crazy!
Who cares if we're crazy? We gotta be crazy!
I know that we're crazy. so let's be crazy!

Dog goes woof, cat goes meow
Bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeak
Cow goes moo. Frog goes croak, and the elephant goes toot
Ducks say quack and fish go blub, and the seal goes ow ow ow
But there's one sound that no one knows...
What does the fox say?
Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!

Joff-tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!
Joff-tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff!
What the fox say?
Big blue eyes, pointy nose, chasing mice, and digging holes
Tiny paws, up the hill, suddenly you're standing still
Your fur is red, so beautiful, like an angel in disguise
But if you meet a friendly horse, will you communicate by mo-o-o-o-orse, mo-o-o-o-orse, mo-o-o-o-orse?
How will you speak to that h-o-o-orse, h-o-o-orse, h-o-o-orse?

What does the fox say?!
The secret of the fox, ancient mystery
Somewhere deep in the woods, I know you're hiding
What is your sound? Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery what do you say?
You're my guardian angel hiding in the woods
What is your sound?

White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man

For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us

Go mad for a couple grams

Well I woke up to the sound of silence
And cries were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the Fourth of July
You swore and said,
""We are not,
We are not shining stars.""
This I know,
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone.
Carry on.
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground.
Carry on.
Carry on, carry on
So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night
At a bar off 75.
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die,
All our neighbours and wives.
But I like to think I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on.
And it's nice to know when I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets,
I am not the ghost you are to me.
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone.
Carry on.
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground.
Carry on.
Whoa!
My head is on fire but my legs are fine.
After all they are mine.
Lay your clothes down on the floor,
Close the door, hold the phones,
Show me how no one’s ever gonna stop us now.
'Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we’re miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone.
Carry on.
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground.
Carry on.
Oooh.
Oooh.
Oooh.
Oooh.

Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, baby
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive

But I do, I do.
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do.
I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me.
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
Trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby

You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl, I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too
'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted
Anyone can tell you you're pretty, yeah
And you get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the make-up
And I wanna show you what I see tonight...
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips.
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause, baby, I wanna make you feel wanted
As good as you make me feel
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're more than everything I need
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
And I just wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I wanna make you feel wanted
Baby, I wanna make you feel wanted
You'll always be wanted

Well, all the parties on the streets are talking, store front mannequins sleeping in lights.
We used to smoke while we were jaywalking like it was your birthday every other saturday night.
Knew The bands so we never payed our cover.
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles.
We never dressed to impress all the others,
They would let us in on our laid back kind of style.
But boy you know it's been a while.
I don't know why you don't take me down town like you got anywhere better to be.
Talk it up and give me the go round, round like a good time tease.
I'm only counting on your cancellation,
When I should be counting on you at my door.
Did you forget about how we went around,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.
Ohhhhhhhh anymore.
I got some platforms sitting in the corner.
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk.
I got a dress that'll show a little uh uh but you ain't gettin' uh uh if you don't come pick me up (damn),
Show me off (wow),
You might be tired, but I'm not!
And I don't know why you don't take me down town like you got anywhere better to be.
Talk it up and give me the go round, round like a good time tease.
I'm only counting on your cancellation,
When I should be counting on you at my door.
Did you forget about how we went around,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.
I don't know why you don't take me downtown like you got anywhere better to be.
Talk it up and give me the go round round like a good time tease.
I'm only counting on your cancellation,
When I should be countin on you at my door.
Did you forget about how we went around,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.
Ohhh anymore.
Yeaaaaah I don't know why you don't take me downtown,
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore.
I just don't get it

Strawberry shimmer on hot lips,
Silver buckle hangin' off her hips.
Eyes sparkle when she smiles.
Shinedown on the radio dial.
Homemade jar o' lemon drop, take a sip.
Don't stop girl, you know I love it when you get your shine on!
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long!
Summer sky dripping rhinestones,
Turn your party lights on,
Baby get your shine on - shine on!
Baby get your shine on!
Silverado, candy painted,
Ray Bans, got the whole world shaded.
Chrome piece tucked in the console,
Riding high, roll up on the down low.
Feeling lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky clear.
So slide that little sugar shaker over here...
And get your shine on!
'Cause you and me be rocking all night long!
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones,
Turn your party lights on,
Baby get your shine on - shine on!
Baby get your shine on!
Homemade jar o' lemon drop take a sip.
Don't stop girl, you know I love it when you get your shine on!

I'm me, I'm me, and that's all I can be
I'm me, I'm me, here's my vulnerability
I'm free and you can't stop me
I'm free and that's all I can be
Days pass, I'm tryna find who I really am
(I've been lookin')
People don't like the way I dress, or where I am at
(I've been lookin')
I dye my hair and it's not just vanity
(I've been lookin')
Your validation is just not that important to me
I'm me, I'm me, and that's all I can be
I'm me, I'm me, here's my vulnerability
I'm free and you can't stop me
I'm free, I'm me, and that's all I can be
Night falls and I find it's here I am in peace
(I've been lookin')
Making friends with spirits lost and it sets me free
(I've been lookin')
Express myself, 'cause it's my liberty
(I've been lookin')
Your validation is just not that important to me
I'm me, I'm me, and that's all I can be
I'm me, I'm me, here's my vulnerability
I'm free and you can't stop me
I'm me, I'm free, and that's all I can be

I am me, I am me, I am me
I am free, I am free, I am free
I am me, I am me, I am me
I am free, I am free
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Create yourself, redo yourself, renew yourself
Be you, do what you do
Hold your head up high, everything's gonna be alright
You're you, I'm me, let's live in harmony
Coexist with each other, love each other
Be yourself, you have to be yourself
Be real, be honest
'Cause ain't nobody got time for that
They really don't
So listen to me, listen to this song
'Cause this is real facts, that will help you move along
Yeah
That's all I wanted to say, so I love you guys so much
Hope you like this song and you know

You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
Everybody's been there
Everybody's been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
Don't run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Show me how big your brave is
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
See you be brave
I just wanna see you (yeah)

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go
Ohhh, oh no
And you let her go
Ohhh, oh no
Well you let her go
Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home

Tailgate for two underneath the stars
Kiss on your lips when you're in my arms

Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song

Outta the blue pulling into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear

Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock,
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you
Recount the night that
I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time I'm still into you
I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)

Of anything and everything

A perfect storm, perfect storm
Cause once you're mine, once you're mine

But down to earth

You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma
Woo!
Damn I think I love her
Shorty so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care

Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing

Drop it low and pick it up just like this (yeah)
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, somethin' worth a half a ticket on my wrist (on my wrist)
Takin' all the liquor straight, never chase that (never)
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back (what?)
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spillin', you should taste that[Chorus — Charli XCX:]
I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane
From L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name
'Bout to blow[Verse 2 — Iggy Azalea:]
I said, ""Baby, I do this, I thought that you knew this""
Can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, they speak it depart it
Swagger on super, I can't shop at no department
Better get my money on time, if they not money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that they give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if they not money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be the I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw[Chorus — Charli XCX:]
I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane
From L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name
'Bout to blow[Bridge — Charli XCX:]
Trash the hotel
Let's get drunk on the mini bar
Make the phone call
Feels so good getting what I want
Yeah, keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah I'm deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch
Ow...[Verse 3 — Iggy Azalea:]
Still stuntin', how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that
Look at it I bet you wishing you could clutch that
It's just the way you like it, huh?
You're so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?
Never turn down nothing
Slaying these hoes, gold trigger on the gun like[Chorus — Charli XCX:]
I'm so fancy
You already know
I'm in the fast lane
From L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy
Can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name
'Bout to blow[Outro]
Who that, who that, I-G-G-Y
That do that, do that, I-I-G-G-Y
Who that, who that, I-G-G-Y

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars
I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Every thing that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be—we'll be counting stars
I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
And I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Every thing that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be—we'll be counting stars
Oh, take that money watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I've learned

Get jazzy on it[Jason Derulo:]
I'm that flight that you get on, international
First class seat on my lap girl, riding comfortable
'Cause I know what the girl them need,
New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps on my passport,
You make it hard to leave[Jason Derulo:]
Been around the world, don't speak their language

Dos, she was all on me-oh

Dos Cadenas, close to genius
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis
Gilbert Arenas, guns on deck
Chest to chest, tongue on neck
International oral sex
Every picture I take, I pose a threat
Bought a jet, what do you expect?
Her pussy's so good I bought her a pet
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under ""Big Booty""
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it

Saturday morning jumped out of bed
And put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet
All the way to you
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is 'No'
Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
Why you gotta be so rude?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Yeah, no matter what you say
Marry that girl
And we'll be a family
Why you gotta be so
Rude
I hate to do this, you leave no choice
Can't live without her
Love me or hate me we will be both
Standing at that altar
Or we will run away
To another galaxy, you know
You know she's in love with me
She will go anywhere I go
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Tough luck, my friend, 'cause the answer's still 'No""

Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But, darling, stay with me
Why am I so emotional?
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt
Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But, darling, stay with me
Oh, won't you stay with me?

[Rihanna:]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy[Eminem:]
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public. Excuse me
For wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew; see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)
Hit the lottery, oh wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
'Cause I'm[Rihanna:]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing[Eminem:]
Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me
To seize the moment and don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.
No wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders.)
Yoda-loda-le-hee-hoo
I think it went wandering off down yonder
And stumbled on 'ta Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the[Rihanna:]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing[Eminem:]
Call me crazy but I have this vision
One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
MCs, blood get spilled and I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
To the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the[Rihanna:]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy[Rihanna:]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

17,Say Something,A Great Big World & Christina Aguilera,2014,A Great Big World,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/futuristic/agreatbigworldsaysomething.html,"

[Hook - Jerrin Jaramillo:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me to
And anywhere I would've followed you
And say something, I'm giving up on you[Verse - Futuristic:]
A lot of stress, she was a mess and I cleaned it up
You needed stuff and I needed something a little different
Say something, say anything, make a face, hold my hand
Kiss my lips to show that you really is committed
Four years is a lot of time, should we dismiss it?
Forget it and live as if it never existed
Emotions, I'm hopeless, it came to grow consistent
Turned a friendship into love, but now that love is sort of distant
I never thought I'd see the day I couldn't make you laugh
Couldn't make you smile, couldn't even make you mad
It's kind of like you're a cast or a mold
Or something from the past that I used to have
I'd do anything to get you back
And you would do anything just to get me back
I guess that's how it is
They say it's better to have loved and lost
But now I feel lost and I don't wanna live
Say something, say that you forgive me
Tell me that you believe me
Have faith that we can make it, I know that it won't be easy
But we could find a way back into that passion
Feel the word love and get lost in the meaning
Put you before me, your wants and your needs
My dreams include every bit of you
I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true
All you gotta do is tell me that you love me too
Say something[Hook - Jerrin Jaramillo:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye
And say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere I would've followed you
And say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something

Wait 'til you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out
(Send the call out) [15x]
Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well
Even the comatose they don't dance and tell[Chorus:]
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air, so there
So all the cups got broke shards beneath our feet but it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release[Chorus:]
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kinda older than I was when I revelled without a care
So there[Chorus:]
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Living in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go
Ohhh, oh no
And you let her go
Ohhh, oh no
Well you let her go
Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy
My friends and I—we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us

Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy
Ooh ooh oh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
Ooh ooh oh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried!
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know!
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door!
I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway!
It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all!
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me I'm free!
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry!
Here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on!
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back
The past is in the past!
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone!
Here I stand
In the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway!

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me[2x]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize[2x]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)

When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call
It's the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made
Don't wanna let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holding on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke
Inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning now I'll see us in the light upon a hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I've been holding on so tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke
Inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
And I been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life
I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life
I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love
Until she's broke (until she's broke inside)
Inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

Than to mess with me, honey
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby[Iggy Azalea:]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world and now we just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got it mirrored
And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing[Pre-Hook — Rita Ora:]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)[Hook — Rita Ora:]

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you I'm doing whatever works
You've never met nobody
That'll do you how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus hallelujah
I'm-a make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breathe for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air
And you lean for it
'Till they have a CAT scan and check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it, on it)
Now it's me-time believe that
If it's yours when you want it
I wouldn't promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back go quick

It's frizz in a bottle
It's Nicki full throttle
It's oh, oh.
Swimming in the grotto
We winning in the lotto
We dipping in the pot of blue foam
Kitten so good
It's drippin' on wood
Get a ride in the engine that could go
Batman Robin it
Bang, bang, cocking it
Queen Nicki dominant, prominent
It's me, Jessie, and Ari
If they test me they sorry
Ride his uh like a Harley
Then pull off in this Ferrari
If he hangin' we bangin'
Phone rangin', he slangin'
It ain't karaoke night but get the mic 'cause I'm singing (uh)
B to da' A to da' N to da' G to da' uh (baby)
B to da' A to da' N to da' G to da' hey
See anybody could be good to you,
You need a bad girl to blow your mind (your mind)[Chorus:]
Bang bang into the room (I know ya want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let ya have it)
Wait a minute lemme take you there (ah)
Wait a minute till ya (ah)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know ya want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let ya have it)
Wait a minute lemme take you there (ah)
Wait a minute till ya (ah)[Outro - Nicki Minaj (overlapping):]
Bang bang into the room (I know ya want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let ya have it)[Nicki Minaj:]
Yo, I said bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
And now I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you
I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights
But I wonder where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees

I jumped so high I touched the clouds

I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night

No, please don't wake me now

And then the sun came crashing in

But all the possibilities
No limits just epiphanies

I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (control)

Never thought that love could cause so much pain
I never thought that loss would leave me strained

It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly
Agree politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up (Hey!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger
A fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero
You held me down, but I got up (Hey!)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey!)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger
A fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar
I got the eye of the tiger
A fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion

I don't mind letting you down easy
But just give it time
If it don't hurt now then just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feeding on
So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't it good being all alone
Where you're from
You might be the one who's running things
Well, you can ring anybody's bell to get what you want
You see, it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're living in a bubble
So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to fool with you?
Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't it good being all alone
Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
Ain't it fun living in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama 'cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama 'cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama 'cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama 'cause you're on your own in the real world
Ain't it fun
Ain't it fun
Baby, now you're one of us
Ain't it fun
Ain't it fun
Ain't it fun
Ain't it fun living in the real world
Ain't it good, ain't it good being all alone
Ain't it fun living in the real world
('Cause the world don't orbit around you)
Ain't it good, ain't it good being all alone (oh)
Don't go crying to your mama 'cause you're on your own in the real world
(Down to your mama)
Don't go crying to your mama 'cause you're on your own in the real world
(Don't go crying to your mama)
Don't go crying to your mama 'cause you're on your own in the real world
(Oh, this is the real world)
Don't go crying to your mama 'cause you're on your own in the real world

The mixtape's got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thumb-thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah, you can find us where the party's at
This is how we roll
We hanging 'round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon, baby
This is how we roll
Yeah, baby, this is how we roll
We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah, holler at your boy if you need a ride
Let's go
If you roll with me, yeah, you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat, oh
Damn!
Them kisses are for me though,
Automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you
But it's for me though
Let's roll!
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you, baby
This is how we roll
LB, go on sing it to 'em![Luke Bryan:]
Yeah, we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah, we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass it around and we dream about one day
'Cause this is how we roll
Come ya'll
We hanging 'round singing out everything on the radio
Get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
This is how we ride
We slingin' up the mud, cuttin' through the countryside,
Baby, this is how we roll
Yeah, this is how we roll
This is how we roll
Yeah, baby
Yeah, LB

Yeah, this is how we roll

Oh whoa-oh-oh-oh

Ooh girl you're shining
Like a 5th avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never going out of style
Ooh pretty baby
This world might've gone crazy
The way you save me
Who can blame me
When I just wanna make you smile?[Hook:]
I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye
Like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this[Chorus:]
You're over my head
I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you,
Baby you're so classic[Tony:]
Four dozen roses
Anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you
Doing it Sinatra style
I'm a pick you up in a Cadillac
Like a gentleman bringin' glamour back
Keep it reel to reel in the way I feel
I could walk you down the aisle[Hook:]
I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye
Like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this[Chorus:]
You're over my head
I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind,
Everything is so throwback-ish (I kinda like it, like it)
Out of my league
Old school chic
Like a movie star
From the silver screen
You're one of a kind living in a world gone plastic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you're so classic
Baby you're so classic[Malcolm:]
Baby you're class and baby you're sick
I never met a girl like you ever 'till we met
A star in the 40s, centerfold in the 50s
Got me tripping out like the sixties
Hippies, Queen of the discotheque
A 70s dream and an 80s best
Hepburn, Beyoncé, Marilyn, Massive
Girl you're timeless, just so classic[Chorus:]
You're over my head I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind,
Everything is so throwback-ish (I kinda like it, like it)

Ah lahmlahlah
Ah lahmlahlah
I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear.""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend.
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10:00.
Baby, bring a lemon and a bottle of gin.
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM.
Baby, if you wanted me then you should've just said.""
She's singing
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How I was confused about
Now she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah[Knock knock knock] on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing
Ah lahmlahlah[2x:]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know

I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing we found love in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said, ""It's nice to meet ya.""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila.
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness,
I'm in deep shit if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now, not
Sobering up we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another
Now she's kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone

Won't you let me know

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
The way that things have been oh, ooh-ooh
The way that things have been oh, ooh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache, from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
(Pain!)
When everything, everything you touch
Turns to gold, gold, gold
When everything, everything (You make me a, you make a believer) everything you touch
Turns to gold (believer) gold
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all (after all)
This city never sleeps tonight
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
In the meantime we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side we used to show
In the moonlight we let it go
We can let this drift away

Oh, let it drift away

I'm on top of the world (Hey!)
Been waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile (Hey!)
Been holding it in for a while (Hey!)
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You've gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You've gotta be so cold

She sees them walking in a straight line, that's not really her style
And they all got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind
Nothing in this world could ever bring them down
Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the background
And she says
""I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids""
He sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue
Yeah, they're living the good life, can't see what he is going through
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where they're going
In the fast lane, living life without knowing
And he says
""I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin' cause you know that it's workin'
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
Let's light it up like it's our last night
We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you, baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down
Burnin' it down
Girl when you want it, you know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like it's our last chance
We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you, baby
Laying right here dreaming in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend,
Thinkin', ""No way she ain't got one.""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off
She was like, ""Oh, my God, this is my song.
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is.""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance.""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later we were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM, too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up
She was like, ""Oh, my God, this is my song.
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is.""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance.""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
The next Friday night
We were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile
When I broke out my guitar
She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song.
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is.""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance.""
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again.""
Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again

You write her name on it, spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey bonfires on it

You bet your life on it

It's that elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground that your dad damned his luck on
That postgame party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
The mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a ten percent down white picket fence house on this dirt
You've mixed some sweat with it, taken a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted goal posts through it (dirt, dirt, dirt...)
You know you came from it (dirt)
And someday you'll return to this...[Chorus:]

Yeah, yeah, yeah
How do we call this?
It's just me
It's just me
It's just me
Me and my broken heart
All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick-start
Me and my broken heart

We came straight from the bottom to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga livin' life like a beginner and this is only beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain, puffin' on clouds and niggas still beginnin'
Million 5 on the Visa card
Hundred bands still look like the fuckin' Titans
Nigga servin' great white like I'm feedin' sharks
I won't do nothin' with the bitch, she can't even get me hard
Somethin' wrong with the pussy
Even though I ain't gon' hit it, I'mma still make sure that she douche it
Me and my woadie, we don't get caught up like that, no way
We ain't got time to go see doctors, J (Who said money?)
Hop up in my bed full of forty bitches and yawnin'
Hey, think this a show bitch, I'm performin'
I do this shit for my daughters and all my sons, bitch
I'mma run up them bands, I'll take care their funds, bitch

Ain't gonna be latching on my niggas aye
Niggas couldn't see me if they had a genie

I stack them racks to the ceiling, now these niggas can't beat me
I just might wake wantin' Chanel and these bitches can't see me
I'm in a whole other league
I ain't got AIDS but I swear to God I would bleed 'til I D.I.E
28 floors up I feel like I could F.L.Y.E.E
Pee on top of these bitches
God told me they can never stop me so they ain't gon' stop me

Hey!
Doublewide Quick Stop, midnight T-top
Jack in her cherry Coke town
Momma and daddy put their roots right here
'Cause this is where the car broke down
Yellow dog school bus kickin' up red dust
Pickin' us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA, no A/C in the vents
We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin', front seat leanin'
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Uptown down home American kids
Growin' up in little pink houses
Makin' out on living room couches
Blowin' that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we're all alright
Hey!
(Hey!)
Baptist church parkin' lot, tryin' not to get caught
Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin' it to second base, but sayin' you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sister's got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
Now he's sittin' out back, 30/30 in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light
We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin', front seat leanin'
Baby, come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone

Growin' up in little pink houses

You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
Everybody's been there
Everybody's been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
Don't run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Show me how big your brave is
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
See you be brave
I just wanna see you (yeah)
I just wanna see you (oh o)
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you

All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California
With my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater 
Lets have an adventure 
Head in the clouds
But my gravity centered
Touch my neck
And I'll touch yours
You in those little high wasted shorts, no
Cause she knows what I think about
What I think about
Is one love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
Cause its too cold, for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater 
Its too cold, for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds 
And moves to a place so far away
The goose bumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
Cause its too cold, for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
Its too cold, for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
All I am, is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California, in California

They roll the sidewalks in this town
All up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here
When midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain
I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
Now all the stars are turnin' blue
Just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for
I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold
Nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
This DJ's on a roll
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight

We can leave the night on
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon

I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is someone sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is someone sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is someone sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane

I heard you're feeling nothing's going right
Why don't you let me stop by?
The clock is ticking, running out of time

Give you something good to celebrate
So make a wish

Give you something good to celebrate
Pop your confetti
Pop your Pérignon
So hot and heavy
'Til dawn

Like a disco ball
All night they're playing
Your song

We're doing it right
You're never gonna be unsatisfied

8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home
All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Saying come on he ain't worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name
Now there's only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye[Chorus:]
What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Till I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise
In the lights
Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
Till the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it till his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me round and let 'em buy a couple more
But before it goes too far I'll let him down easy
Cause tonight is all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay[Chorus:]
What I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Till I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise
In the lights
Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
Till the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it till his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I'm coming in hot
Hey Bartender[Chorus:]
Oh what I'm really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
Till I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise
In the lights
Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
Till the party and music and the truth collide
Bring it till his memory fades away
Hey bartender

One thing I ask of you
Lemme be the one you back that ass to
Come on from Malibu to Paris boo
Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you pass through

Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable[Pharrell:]
Everybody get up[T.I.:]
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I'm just watching and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimping
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, this pimpin'[Robin Thicke:]

[Shakira:]
And I left a note on my bedpost
Said not to repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory
The way you make me feel yeah
You got a hold on me
I've never met someone so different
Oh here we go
You part of me now, you part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow
I can't remember to forget you
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory
Is us kissing in the moonlight
I can't remember to forget you
I can't remember to forget you[Rihanna:]
I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I'm tryna say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory
Way he makes me feel like
Way he makes me feel
I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh here we go
He part of me now, he part of me[Shakira:]
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow, oh[Both:]
I can't remember to forget you
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory
Is us kissing in the moonlight
I can't remember to forget you[Shakira:]
I'd rob and I'd kill to keep him with me
I'd do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'd do anything for that boy[Rihanna:]
I'd rob and I'd kill to keep him with me
I'd do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'd do anything for that boy[Both:]
I can't remember to forget you
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me

[Calum:]
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all[Luke:]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all[Calum:]
The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all[Luke:]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all

Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna show you how
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna take you down
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna show you how
Afraid to lose control
And caught up in this world
I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
I think I've thought myself to death
I was born without this fear
Now only this seems clear
I need to move, I need to fight
I need to lose myself tonight
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna take you down
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna show you how
I think with my heart and I move with my head
I open my mouth and it's something I've read
I stood at this door before, I'm told
But a part of me knows that I'm growing too old
Confused what I thought with something I felt
Confuse what I feel with something that's real
I tried to sell my soul last night
Funny, he wouldn't even take a bite
Far away
I heard him say (come with me now)
Don't delay
I heard him say (come with me now)
Far away
I heard him say (come with me now)
Don't delay
I heard him say (come with me now)
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna take you down
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna show you how
Afraid to lose control
And caught up in this world
I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
I think I've thought myself to death

I wanna be free, I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac, that is my shit
Now throw it up (now throw that up)
That's what it is (that's what it is)
In my C A D I L L A C bitch (biatch)
Can't see me through my tints (nuh uh)
I'm riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint wet dripping shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain't got 24s (nuh uh)
But I'm on those Vogues
That's those big white walls
R-r-round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I'm rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello, haters, damn y'all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?[Hollis:]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rollin' that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright[Macklemore:]
Man I'm lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would've been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that's stylish
Smilin', don't pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going a hundred and twenty
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I'm smashing
I'm ducking bucking them out here
I'm looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it's like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater
Yea, I'm from Seattle, there's hella Honda Civics
I couldn't tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, there's a problem with this geezer
Got the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rollin' that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright[ScHoolboy Q:]
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhaling my love, tryna blow my mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14 I stole his keys
Me and my niggas was gone
Stealin' portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Drivin' smiling like I won a fucking lottery homes (fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it and the Vogues, too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keeping the buns
All on my dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all, kill the fucking whips
See what's poppin' at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my balls
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe... some
Swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga, fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished, Q[Hollis:]
Off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rollin' that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rollin' that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

This what me and her be doin in the back of the Maybach when we listenin to Beyonce
Listen![Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Driver roll up the partition please (Uh Huh)
Blind your rear view mirror with the end of my sleeves (Uh Huh)
The shit that's on my wrist you probably wouldn't believe (Uh Uh)
Every symbols of success levels you couldn't achieve (AHHHH!!!)
Driver roll up the partition please (Uh Huh)
I'm alarmed at how's she's lookin and she's startin to breathe
Threw my arm and grabbed my john and now she's startin to squeeze (WOO!)
She dropped to her knees (Uh Huh) fulfillin my needs (Uh Huh)
She swallowed my seeds (Uh Huh) she's ready to go (Let's go)
Partition is up (Uh Huh) the curtains is closed (Ok!)
Mami nice with it like she played for the pros (That's Right)
She gagged from her throat, while she breathe from her nose (Oh shit!)
She startin to choke (Uh Huh) she curlin her toes 
Look how she tryin to take it off now, come out your clothes (That's Right)
I waited for a second now I thought for a minute
Ain't no lovin good enough to give her while I'm up in it (Tell 'em B!)[Interlude: Beyonce (Busta Rhymes)]

Slept slept and I crip crep in the six seven

The tit and the rump and I'm flippin I'm dumpin I'm trickin I'm trumpin them
But these niggas wanna spend they cheese, tell 'em hit up lil' Miss A.Z.
Very heavy headed to take heed, I'm a flip out if a bitch play me (If a bitch play me)[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Driver roll up the partition please
Driver roll up the partition please, I don't need you seein 'yonce on her knees

Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blastin, he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red whine drip we'll talk that trash, chauffeur eavesdroppin tryin not to crash
Whoa there daddy daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh baby baby we better slow it down
Took forty five minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even 'gon make it to this club[Chorus: Beyonce]
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)
The kind of girl you like (Girl you like)
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)
The kind of girl you like is right here with me
(Right here with me right here with me right here with me right here with me)[Bridge:]
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire, I'activite' physique, le coit, Tu aimes ca?
Tu nu t'interesses pas au sexe?
Les hommes pensent que les feministes destestent le sexe mais c'est
Une activite tres stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent[Chorus: Beyonce]
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)
The kind of girl you like (Girl you like)
Take all, of me, I just wanna be the girl you like (Girl you like)
The kind of girl you like is right here with me

[Part I: 0 to 100]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bills shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on their turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shout-out to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dog
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a motherfuckin' lay-up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Ayy, who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should probably sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they're like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga[Part II: The Catch Up]
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit, yeah
The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dog
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

I'll never settle down,
That's what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man,
Just ask anyone
I don't dance, But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It Ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere
Guess you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I don't dance
Love's never come my way,
I've never been this far
But you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart
No, I don't dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere
Guess you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don't dance
Ohhh
I don't dance

Of men armed with weapons, hey, oh

In holy matrimony

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmm...)
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud
So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride[Charlie Puth:]
It's been a long day without you, my friend

Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (let me tell you)
When I see you again
(Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah[Wiz Khalifa:]
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost (and the love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone (remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride[Charlie Puth:]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take, will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began

Shut up and dance with me""
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
My discothèque, Juliet teenage dream
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
""Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me!""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ""Ooh-ooh-hoo
Shut up and dance with me""
Oh, come on girl
Deep in her eyes
I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
""Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me!""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ""Ooh-ooh-hoo
Shut up and dance!""
""Don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me!""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ""Ooh-ooh-hoo
Shut up and dance with me""
Ooh-ooh-hoo, shut up and dance with me
Ooh-ooh-hoo, shut up and dance with me

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar

Your man on the road, he doing promo
You said keep our business on the low-low
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Driving through the gated residential
Found out I was coming, sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up, don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
You gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feeling like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine

[Verse 1:]
When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stays strong
Yeah, yeah
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say[Pre-chorus:]
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
I'm like no, not really 'cause[Chorus:]
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her[Verse 2:]
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes
Like a genie in a bottle
Yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say[Pre-chorus:]
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
I'm like no, not really 'cause[Chorus:]
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her[Instrumental break][Bridge:]
She gives me love and affection
Baby, did I mention
You're the only girl for me
No, I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question[Chorus:]
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I've found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time

I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shining, I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talking trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz
Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wilding
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday morning
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that's all I want
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinking, ""How could I be so selfish?""
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinking, ""How could I be so reckless?""
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness (mhm)
Is taken for weakness

And some guy's getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well

You can pretend that it was me

Ya say Roro, you know I did it right?
Who is Rickey Wayne the mixtape
Ya feel me?
First let me hop out the motherfucking Porsche
I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be balling on these niggas got me feeling like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Ain't too many things I ain't done yet
I'm the king of this shit
Crowned by the toilet
I'm just barely getting started
You already upset
Got a tiger as a pet
I just took him to the vet
Homie I be making hits
I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me
Like she was on a feeder
If the pussy ain't good
Then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie you can keep her
Cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout a feature
Homeboy you's a pee on toilet seat
Ass nigga man I swear you getting peed on
Man, my jewelry so cold I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set just in case they wanna sleep on
Ya dig
I'm a full time player
Hopping out in alligator
Sipping lean and now and later
Homie, I'll annihilate ya
If you think you wanna battle
You gon' have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her
I would never ever date her
It's a shame how I'm barely getting love in the city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fucking with me
I be killing this shit
Pray to God they forgive me
They said, ""When you blow up don't forget me, ""
Man
I been on fire
Ever since they made the lighter
My boys will pull up on ya, homie, I ain't talking diapers
Walk into your function on point I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her
Flexing all you want but homeboy you ain't ready
Ten times sharper than Michael Myer's machete
Been about the money I ain't worried 'bout the fame
'Bout to have everybody saying, ""Who is Rickey Wayne?""
That's me

[Verse 1 - Nicki Minaj:]
Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did I'd Minaj wid' him and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yea, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout ya'll niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, Jon and Kate plus eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a up-date
Hut hut one, hut hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
Dez hoes couldn't test me even if they name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with', mad bitches we don't fuck with'
I don't fuck with' them chickens unless they last name is cut let
Let it soak in like seasoning
And tell them bitches, blow me, Lance Stephenson[Hook - Chris Brown:]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only[Verse 2 - Drake:]
I never fucked Nicki cause she got a man
But when that's over then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought God damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yea, low key or maybe high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yea, that's right, I like my girls BBW, yea
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Claire Huxtable
Oh, yea, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that's cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever try to fuck
Just give me the heads up so I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, aye)[Hook][Verse 3 - Lil' Wayne:]
I never fucked Nic and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she act like she need dick in her life
But that's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend would beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mother's instead
You got the hiccups, you swallow the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, street beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout running in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I been praising, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang take the B off behavior, my nigga
For reals if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off, nigga
Now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in the clip, one in the chamber
17 ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from poor me
To please pour me a drink and celebrate with me[Hook]

And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade—it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
And I will stay up through the night
And let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one
You did not break me
(You did not break me, no)
I'm still fighting for peace
Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart

Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your

The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants, baby

I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I gotta heart rush, it ain't slowin' down
I got it real bad, want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh she's giving you now
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then you'd want me just as much
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush
I don't get no sleep, I don't get no peace
Thinkin' about her under your bedsheets
The way that she's whisperin', the way that she's pullin' you in
Lord knows I've tried, I can't get her off my mind
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, 'cause they taste like you

[Verse 1 - Drake:]
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other
Whoop! Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it[Verse 2 - Nicki Minaj:]
Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this is 65 million singles sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ball, point game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is ya here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now?
Uhh, do ya hear me?
I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne:]
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I put one leg on the tub
Girl, that's my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude, what's his name? Not important
I bought some cocaine if you snortin'
And she became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless n' flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge and born in New Orleans
Get killed 4 Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly; Drake, Tunechi and Barbie

But I got nothing here without you
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise, after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
I don't deserve it
I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me?

And don't forget the flowers every anniversary
'Cause if you treat me right
I'll be the perfect wife
Buying groceries
Buy-buying what you need
You got that ""9 to 5""
But, baby, so do I
So don't be thinking I'll be home and baking apple pies
I never learned to cook
But I can write a hook
Sing along with me
Sing-sing along with me
You gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm acting crazy
Tell me everything's alright
Dear future husband,
Here's a few things
You'll need to know if you wanna be
My one and only all my life

Tell me I'm beautiful each and every night
After every fight
Just apologize
And maybe then I'll let you try and rock my body right
Even if I was wrong
You know I'm never wrong
Why disagree?
Why, why disagree?
If you gotta know how to treat me like a lady

Open doors for me and you might get some kisses
Don't have a dirty mind
Just be a classy guy
Buy me a ring
Buy-buy me a ring, babe
You gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm acting crazy
Tell me everything's alright
Dear future husband
Here's a few things
You need to know if you wanna be
My one and only all my life
Dear future husband,
If you wanna get that special loving
Tell me I'm beautiful each and every night
That's right!
Future husband, better love me right

You got the healing that I want

Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself

I got to have you, babe

[Meghan Trainor:]
I found myself dreaming
In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight
And you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone
I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you[John Legend:]
In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, baby
Any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regrets
Let's take our time
To say what we want
Use what we got
Before it's all gone
'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow[Both:]
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
Hey
Whoa
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you

Only thing I've got is this foolish game
Standin' in front of these lights while they call my name (oh yeah)

Never thought that love could cause so much pain
I never thought that loss would leave me strained

Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
They strung up a man
They say who murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight
In the hanging tree
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
Where dead man called out
For his love to flee
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight
In the hanging tree
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
Where I told you to run
So we'd both be free
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met at midnight
In the hanging tree
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?[Original line:] Wear a necklace of rope[Line modified for effect:] Wear a necklace of hope
Side by side with me

Yes, I do, I believe
That one day I will be
Where I was right there
Right next to you
And it's hard
The days just seem so dark
The moon and the stars
Are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin
Where do I begin?
No words can explain
The way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness
This hole that I'm inside
These tears
They tell their own story
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy[This verse is only in the album version:]
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Lay me down tonight
Lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight
Lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you

Yo, Yah

I finna, I finna, finna show you how to
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan
I'm finna show you how to
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan
I paper chase then vanish
Hit the Quan on her make her boyfriend panic
I heart Memphis, but I also love dancing
I done took off on em, I don't plan on landing
I call shots just do it like Nike
No FaceTime but the people want to Skype me
If I do time then who would really write me?
I stay on y'all mind but, oh, I think they like me
Clean pair of sneaks, with a designer belt
Please watch your step cause I'm feeling myself
Throw a flag on the play, man somebody get the ref
Cop blah la la la low, man somebody get some help
Pull up on the block
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arms
I said get down low and hit the Quan
I'm finna show you how to
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arms
I said get down low and hit the Quan
Pull up on the block and do the dance like crazy
This chick is hella hot but I know this chick crazy
If I think she not then that makes me crazy
We are both thots so we are both crazy
Flexing always on my agenda
Your whole team rats, your CEO is Master Splinter
Bout to hit the Quan and turn that girl into a member
Now my whole team flexing, I think we got a winner
People want to dap it up but they can't get none from me
I went to jail and snap it up, at least I had bum money
People wanna walk around me tryna steal my lingo
Just make sure when you talk about me you say he's doing his thing though
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan
I'm finna show you how to
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan

I went to the moped store, said, ""Fuck it.""
Salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds.""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me.""
Oh it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like Dally
Pulled up, moped to the valley
Whitewalls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'mma lick that, stick that, break her off (Kit-Kat)
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope
Killing the game 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie own a Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
God damn man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'mma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the wasabi[Clean version:] I'm so low that my cajones almost dragging on the concrete[Explicit version:] I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player
Downtown, downtown (downtown)
Downtown, downtown (downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that could keep us safe
(downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
(downtown)
Of the leather seat between your legs
(hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
(hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
(downtown)
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards

What you see is what you get girl
Don't ever forget girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown
Dope
Cut the bullshit
Get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw
Moped like a bullet
(peeyow!)
It can't catch me
A po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Because I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out, ""Who that is?""
It's me, the M the A-C the K
Stunting like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I watch her skate
I mean, water ski, ollie ollie oxen free
I'm perusing down fourth and they watching me
I do a handstand, an eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down.""
Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit player, Tiramisu, Tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit
Downtown, downtown (downtown)
Downtown, downtown
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that could keep us safe
(downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
(downtown)
Of the leather seat between your legs
(hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)

Kick the dust up
Come on
All week long it's a farming town
They're making that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on, girl, kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac
We go way out where
There ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up
Bar downtown, they got a line
Of people waiting out the door
Ten dollar drinks, it's packed inside
I don't know what they're waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ear
And it's like knock knock knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people
We go way out where
There ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up

Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up
Just follow me down 'neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did
Kick it
We go way out where
There ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up (kick the dust up)
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That's what's up up
Let's kick the dust up

[Intro:]
Look, I feel blessed
Way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
Straight up[Verse 1 - Big Sean:]
I live the life I deserve, bless
Fuck a vaca' I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth
I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gonna go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give em Heaven on Earth for a hell of a check
Yeah whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father forgive me these are all my confessions
Man this wasn't luck it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Who flip like confetti and then when you back they back to call you dog
That shit get get petty, bitch don't give no dap to me nigga
Funny thing about talkin' behind my back
Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga
Was off for a sec now it's back to me nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want man this what it had to be
This is that late night workin' after three
Man this is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta, thank God that we got it, blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your profit we profit, oh God[Hook - Drake:]
I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed straight up
I'm way up I feel blessed straight up, straight up, way up I feel blessed[Verse 2 - Drake:]
Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'
Cause that implies that we're back from somethin'
If we're back from somethin' it's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothin' less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammies go
I just gave out Grammies on my Instagram
Them OVO boys the business man
It is what it is, trust me you get what you give
You gotta come to my side and see how we live
I cannot see Heaven bein' much better than this
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the Six
Look at what we did
Be quiet I'm doin' a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doin' the most
Stop worryin' about whoever's next
I am just worried about my mama worryin' less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need anymore press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doin' this shit man[Hook - Drake][Verse 3 - Big Sean:]
My grandma just died I'm the man of the house
So every mornin' I'm up cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm goin' overtime on the overtime
Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, man it's to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never goin' under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who put it back together[Hook - Drake][Verse 4 - Kanye West:]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
C3POs like Star Wars
They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now callin' you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled
I'm blessed, and I was thinkin' 'bout startin' up my own school
A Montessori, and the hallway lookin' like a monastery
Oh yes I'm way up, I feel blessed

Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb
Now, I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun
I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a lifetime
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on
But I know you can take it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long (all night long)
I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If I'd have known where I'd be now
Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh, I could do this for a lifetime
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on
But I know you can take it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I ever breathed without you
Baby, you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time, one more time
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on
But I know you can take it up, up, up, up all night long

Ah lahmlahlah
Ah lahmlahlah
I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear.""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend.
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10:00.
Baby, bring a lemon and a bottle of gin.
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM.
Baby, if you wanted me then you should've just said.""
She's singing
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How I was confused about
Now she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah[Knock knock knock] on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing
Ah lahmlahlah[2x:]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
My friends had you figured out
Yeah, they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake
I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah, it's still burning[2x:]
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
Each time that I think you're gone
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you under my skin
Guess I love living in the sin
Oh you never told me
True love was gonna hurt
True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learn[2x:]
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Stop the haunting baby
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
No more haunting baby
I keep going to the river[2x:]
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

(I guess right now you've got the last laugh)
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it but really
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and
Your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen
To some music with a message (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand it
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwing up 'cause
He can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking 'bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here

My feet can't touch the ground,
Touch the ground, and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Every time you are not around

I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream
I wish I could make it easy
Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach
To find a way
I'm stuck here in between
I'm looking for the right words to say

Wave after wave, wave after wave

I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they're better as friends
Not even when you saying, ""Drizzy, tell 'em again!""
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' bossy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they're gon'
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh, girl for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own. Well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't
But you still hit my phone up
And, baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love. Now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think (you think) that I'm (that I'm) still holdin' on (holdin' on) to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

2,Sorry,Justin Bieber,2016,Justin Bieber,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/justinbieber/sorry.html,"

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time. Could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know-oh-oh, that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know-oh-oh, that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (your body), oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?

Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Baby, I like your style
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Tell me, I need to know, where do you wanna go?
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, ""Wake up, you need to make money.""
Yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, ""Wake up, you need to make money.""
Yeah
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out (oh)
Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
Saying, ""Wake up, you need to make money.""

Bitbitan na ba ng bayag sige palag to
Baka di kayo na inform na ngayon ay halimaw na
Yung batang uhugin na dati nyong inignore
Bilang patunay na di kayo bagay ihanay sa dati nyong inismall
Ngayon sa lakas kapag bumundol yanig hanggang Japan pag nagpalindol
Kamusta lahat ng mapangmaliit? ngayon nyo subukan manglait ulit
Ganyan lang talaga yang mga ingit, galit na galit sila sa malulupit
Kaya pasensya pag may nahagip, sarap ba sa feeling? ano masakit?
Ganyan talaga pag labag sa loob mong humanga at pag takot kang bumilib
Puta diba napakasaklap
Ginigiit na wala kong talento pero isa ka sa napalakpak
Tigil-tigilan na kakaputak, sa pandinig mo ay isalpak
At damahin ang laman ng awitin hanggang sa ang utak mo ay mabakbak
Ano masarap ba?
Nakakatuwa lang lahat mga talangka
Pare-pareho ng kinahiligan pero bat naghihilahan pababa
Dahil ba di matanggap na kinaya ko na lahat ng hindi nyo magawa
Parang hinamak niyo lamang ang karagatan na ang gamit lang ay bangka
Hibang ka na yata (hibang ka na yata...)
Lahat ng may maling tono makakababa na sa trono
Handa naman ako pakinggan kayo wag niyo lang ako gawin bobo
Bueno eto na ang malinaw na sagot ko sa napakalabong tanong
Kung bakit ako sumusulat, upang patunayan na hindi ako patapon
Alam nyo ba yon? malamang hindi, kasi hindi kayo alisto
Sa sobrang bulag nyo sa katotohanan lahat kayo ay pinanis ko
Hindi na uso dito palawakan ng koneksyon
Kung di ka isa sa bihasa malabong makakuha ng atensyon
Hindi ako nakipag unahan pero bakit ako ang nasa harapan
Samantalang yung nakipagtulakan sa likuran sila pa ang napagiwanan
Ako ba ang dapat na alisin o baka di pa din napansin
Kung tutuusin ay mas malagim ang ugaling palaging nagmamagaling
Lokohin nyo lelang niyo wala na kayong mauulol pa
Sapanahon na to sa listahan ng mahusay ako ay nakaburda
Lahat mahiya, walang hiya na ngayon yung matagal niyo ng kinutya
Pano ba yan panahon ko naman dahil yung panahon niyo ay tapos na, rahh!
Shout out to my boy Flow-G, I'm gonna kill this shit right now, yeah
(Bibeh!)
Ang mundong to lunod sa inggit puro linta kung magsi-sipsip
Kapag may bago nako antimano tingin na agad nag susumiksik
Kaso iba ko pag may nakita ko meron na agad ako na bagong plano
Kung pano maglaho yung taong ayaw mag-iba, yung papalitan ko na ng bago
Kakatapos ko lang maturukan ayoko na makipag ululan
Gusto ko na kasi yung may kabuluhan
At bukod pa dyan ayoko na rin makipagusap kung walang katuturan
Dahil lahat ng bagay na di makakatulong tagal ko ng tinuldukan
Dapat kilala niyo na pangalan ko
Teka puta pare ba't ang yabang mo?
Dapat puta matigas pangharang mo
Lalambot ka sa bigat ng barang ko
Alam mo bang pang malupit ang banat ko?
Hindi ka na dito belong
'Tang inamo pag kami nangyamot sayo dapat hindi ka pikon
Pano mo nasabi na hindi ko kaya makipagsabayan
Sa mga ganito patayan kayang-kaya ko tapakan ang pangalan mo
Putang ina mo ngayon sino satin ang magaling
Isang baheng para sa mga praneng!
Hanggat wala akong nakikitang duguan wala akong sasantuhin
Pag naakit dagit sakin
Kahit di ka lumapit, gamit karit ibibitin ka ng patiwarik
Habang umiiyak at sumisigaw ng bakit
Matik sakin grabeng pasakit kapag sumabit
Hindi pwedeng hindi magpapanic
Matakot ka na pag ako ang nagalit
Ako ang tulay mo patungo sa langit!

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavy when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it
Moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it
So don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon
So keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on
Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
Don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it
Moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue
But I'm OK
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them
Again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you,
I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson
OK
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
No, we ain't ever getting older

12,7 Years,Lukas Graham,2016,Lukas Graham,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lukasgraham/7years.html,"

Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
Once I was seven years old
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely""
Once I was eleven years old
I always had that dream, like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old
(Lukas Graham!)
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old
Soon we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be thirty years old
I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother, I'm still sorry
Soon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life, and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon I'll be sixty years old
Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon I'll be sixty years old
Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
Once I was seven years old
Once I was seven years old

I was good on my own, that's the way it was

You was good on the low for a faded fuck
On some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kicking to you
Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooh, you needed me
You been rolling around, shit I'm rolling up
Light and roll it up
Break it down, like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real, on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kicking to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I'll give it to ya

Open up the champagne, pop!
It's my house, come on, turn it up
Hear a knock on the door and the night begins
Cause we done this before so you come on in
Make yourself at my home, tell me where you been
Pour yourself something cold, baby, cheers to this
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what we is
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in
Welcome to my house
Baby, take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me what you do now
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my house
Morning comes and you know that you wanna stay
Close the blinds, let's pretend that the time has changed
Keep our clothes on the floor, open up champagne
Let's continue tonight, come on, celebrate
Sometimes you gotta stay in
And you know where I live
Yeah, you know what we is
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in

Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me what you do now
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my house
Welcome to my duck off the crib, the spot, the pad
But my house is your house if you throwin' it back
Excuse me if my home's draining the sad
Soon as these happy faces land you can run with the cash
Homerun, slam dunk, touchdown pass
Mi casa es tu casa so it ain't no holding back
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass
It's my house, just relax
Welcome to my house
Baby, take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house
Play that music too loud
Show me what you do now
We don't have to go out
Welcome to my house

I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs
I took a plane to my home town
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said
You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All that I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all that I know are sad songs, sad songs

I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind

On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was

Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignored them still
All these questions they're for real
Like ""Who would you live for?""
""Who would you die for?""
And ""Would you ever kill?""

Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help

Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city

[Justin Bieber:]
Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own
And if you feel you're sinking
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own
And if you feel you're sinking
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know
I won't let go (I won't let go, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight[MØ:]
Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just want to stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope
Someone is gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know[Justin Bieber & MØ:]
You won't let go (I won't let go, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
You won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight[Justin Bieber:]
I won't let go
I won't let go

Just the guitar. OK, cool.
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me
Mmm
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting you and me
Mmm
That was what you told me
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover

You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)

Baby, I'm still rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)
Mmm
There's only one way down
I'm giving you up

Taking it slow, but it's not typical
He already knows that my love is fire
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roamed
I turned him to gold and took him higher
Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time only we knew
Hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
Hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Say you'll never let me go

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying

I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah
These days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh

Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix (Six)
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted

Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out
Flood my cross with ice, getting money my religion
Got my baby mamma and my side bitch kissing

I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman

Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you boy
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you boy
Yeah, there's somethin' 'bout you boy

[Olivia O'Brien:]
Feeling used
But I'm still missing you
And I can't see the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her[Gnash:]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too
And I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh, oh
Keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go[Olivia O'Brien:]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her[Gnash:]
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night I sing this song[Olivia O'Brien and Gnash:]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you[Olivia O'Brien:]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
All alone I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care you never did
You don't give a damn about me[Olivia O'Brien and Gnash:]
Yeah, all alone I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you ever see
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?[Olivia O'Brien:]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

39,Here,Alessia Cara,2016,Alessia Cara,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alessiacara/here.html,"

(I guess right now you've got the last laugh)
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it but really
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and
Your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen
To some music with a message (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand it
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwing up 'cause
He can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking 'bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know

I'm not one to forget, you know
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh (that same old love) [2x]
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh (that same old love) [2x]
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

I found myself dreaming
In silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight
And you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone
I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you[John Legend:]
In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, baby
Any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regrets
Let's take our time
To say what we want
Use what we got
Before it's all gone
'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow[Both:]
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing

Reaching out to you, so take a chance
No matter where you go
Know you're not alone

Come along with me and don't be scared
I just wanna set you free
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You and me can make it anywhere
But for now, we can stay here for a while
'Cause you know, I just wanna see you smile
No matter where you go
You know you're not alone
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away
And when you're weak I'll be strong
I'm gonna keep holding on
Now don't you worry, it won't be long
Darling, and when you feel like hope is gone
Just run into my arms
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me

From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you
But now we're sleeping at the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
And I'll be me
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
And I'll be me
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
There's no force on earth
Could make it feel right, no
Whoa
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
Think now's the time to let it slide
So come on, let it go
Just let it be
Why don't you be you
And I'll be me?
Everything that's broke
Leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall
Forget about me

I used to be so happy
But without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me but I feel there's something you should know
I will never forget you
You'll always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart I will always be sure
I will never forget you

Everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
I can't hide my connection with you

Sellin' a dream

Driving the edge of a knife

Don't fall asleep
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough
Know we're good enough
Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven is a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh, baby, baby
Never let you go, never let you go go
Never let you go, never let you go go
Never let you go, whoa
No, never let you go, whoa
Never let you go 
Never let you go go
Never let you go 
Never let you go go
Oh, no, no, no

Yeah, yeah

Let me love you
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah

When the sun had left and the winter came
And the sky fall to only bring the rain
I sat in darkness
All broken-hearted
I couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone
I never meant to cry, started losing hope
But somehow baby
You broke through and saved me
You're an angel. Tell me you're never leaving
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You made the brightest days from the darkest nights
You're the river bank where I was baptized
Cleansed from the demons
That were killing my freedom
Let me lay you down, give me to ya
Get you singing, babe, hallelujah
We'll be touching
We'll be touching heaven
You're an angel. Tell me you're never leaving
'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
I don't need these stars 'cause you shine for me
Like fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy
You're my ecstasy
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're holy, holy, holy, holy
I'm high on loving you, high on loving you
You're the healing hands where it used to hurt
You're my saving grace, you're my kind of church
You're holy

You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain

Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you might want me to
Come show up at your door

Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes

Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord, please save her for me, do this one favor for me
I had to change my player ways, got way too complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say
That way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so (Yeah)
So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me
Break it down, yeah
Yes sir
Check
We used to lay up and then stay up
Have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just leveled-up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak, that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man, it's true, exes change, yeah
Ayy, guess you changed for the better (Better!)

Turn up with young Tiller, we just gettin' loose
Maybe I'm lowkey feelin' you, don't be cynical
Won't fuck you over, wanna fuck you over and again
The truth is I ain't really here to start problems

Know how bad you wanna tell 'em, ""don't try him""
I don't wanna tell 'em, let's surprise 'em
I don't wanna get into it – why you stressin' him? I've been drivin'
Back and forth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass in my grip
College make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl, I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you

You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Look what you've done!

Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that roadster SV, ah
Pockets over weight getting hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry
I come alive in the fall time I
No competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks, a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man
I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Look what you've done!

Look what you've done!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm a motherfuckin' Starboy
Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
Hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks, a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face
Man, I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Look what you've done!

Would you fuck me for free?
Another one
We the Best Music! Major Key! DJ Khaled![Verse 1 - Drake:]
I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last 223 thousand hours
It's cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free!
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
Got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat flat
And your ass on what's that?
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl not right now
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in her... man[Hook - Drake:]
I always wonder if you ask yourself
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to...[Verse 2 - Drake:]
Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl you throw it back like one love
Even let me smash on the tour bus
Yeah I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet[Hook - Drake:]
I always wonder if you ask yourself
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to...
Would you fuck me for free?[DJ Khaled:]
Another one
They don't want me to have another anthem
So I made sure I got another anthem

One time for 40
One time for Drake
Another one

What I would do to take away this fear of being loved
Allegiance to the pain

He'll never be like you
I would give anything to change this fickle-minded heart
That loves fake shiny things
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you

All alone she was living
In a world without an end or beginning
Baby girl was living life for the feeling
But I don't mind, I don't mind
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind
And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone
In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
He sang a song when he did it
He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time, all the time
It made her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time, all the time
And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone
In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
I don't think you understand [4x]
In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

What's that icy thing hangin' 'round my neck?
That's gold, show me some respect

And I can't help lovin' myself

They can't do it like I do

Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa, and then I let him go
Now, there's one in California who's been cursing my name
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em all
They won't let go

Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring
My, my, how the seasons go by
I get high, and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking, and the heads just roll
You know that's how the story goes
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me

Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
Happy man, baby
Mmm
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, you're a Goddess,
The cutest, the hottest,
A masterpiece
It's too good to be true,
Nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah
I don't need no vacation,
No fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home,
Listen to the radio
Or dance around the fireplace
And if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could girl
I could die, I could die a happy man

When I met you in April
You were looking like May

So go on and set the pace

But I don't need to chase

Just fake it till you feel it
Open up and let me in
I just wanna feel you

Close enough to feel this moment
Closer, Closer

Like the Sun in December
Or a lemonade in June
I know what you want girl
'Cause I want it too

That I can't see straight
'Cause I'm hooked on your body
Got me glued to your waist
Take another hit
Just fake it till you feel it
Open up and let me in

I'm sittin' on the couch like it's my house
You a bad girl, take a time out
Matter fact, you can bring a friend
My voice sound like silk in the wind
Henny bottles on my table
The owner was a fan, so that's already paid for
Girls lookin' at me like I got a halo
I don't do second dates, that's just how the game go
Look at my life, I made that shit
Look at my car, I suede that shit
Replay that shit

Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam, dog, ten toes down, dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society, all this pressure give me anxiety

I'm devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal
Naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'mma jump from a plane or stand in front of a train
Cause I'm a sucker for pain[Wiz Khalifa:]
Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses[Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris:]

Take my hand through the flames

Out of town, one night teaser
Need to tell them other niggas ease up

And I know from the first time, the first time

Even though, girl, I know that I will fall for you
You got to know that everyone falls
Oops, I done fell too deep, baby
Oops, I think you got me, baby
Oops, I want you for me, baby

And if you want me

Everyone falls in love sometimes

By the time you read it I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby we gone be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair

76,Lost Boy,Ruth B,2016,Ruth B,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ruthb/lostboy.html,"

There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile
He said, ""Peter Pan. That's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run, lost boy"", they say to me
""Away from all of reality""
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free
He sprinkled me in pixie dust 
And told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town 
That never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run, lost boy"", they say to me
""Away from all of reality""
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free
Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last
Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook
You are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last
And for always I will say
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run, lost boy"", they say to me
""Away from all of reality""
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free

Could dress up
To get love
But guess what?
I'm never gonna be that girl
Who's living in a Barbie world
Could wake up
In make up,
And play dumb
Pretending that I need a boy
Who's gonna treat me like a toy
I know the other girls wanna wear expensive things
Like diamond rings
But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string
This queen don't need a king
Oh, I don't know what you've been told
But this girl right here's gonna rule the world
Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty
You get off on your 9 to 5
Dream of picket fences and trophy wives
But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be
No, I don't wanna sit still look pretty
Mr. Right could be nice for one night
But then he wanna take control
And I would rather fly solo
That Snow White
She did right
In her life
Had 7 men to do the chores
'Cause that's not what a lady's for
The only thing a boy's gonna give a girl for free's captivity
And I might love me some vanilla but I'm not that sugar sweet
Call me HBIC

Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again

Staring at two different views on your window ledge
Coffee has gone cold, it's like time froze
There you go wishing, floating down our wishing well
It's like I'm always causing problems, causing hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
We're gonna sweep this under the carpet
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle
You in the middle
You in the middle
Lying down beside you. What's going through your head?
The silence in the air felt like my soul froze
Am I just overthinking feelings I conceal?
This gut feeling I'm tryna get off me as well
I hope we find our missing pieces and just chill
We're gonna sweep it under the carpet
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world for us two
With you in the middle
You in the middle
You in the middle
With you
You

Just thank the children

It's a little blurry how the whole thing started
I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down

You were talking deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
I always hear, always hear them talking
Talking 'bout a girl, 'bout a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you but I still don't get it
You didn't love me, no, not really
Wait, I could have really liked you
I'll bet, I'll bet that's why I keep on thinking 'bout you
It's a shame (shame), you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down
And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You got yourself in a dangerous zone
Cause we both have the fear, fear of being alone
And I still don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And my heart don't understand it, understand it, understand it
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind

Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (Pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (Lifestyle)
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (Do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum (They do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl, let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They're still out to get me cause they never got me
They're still out to get me, I don't get it
I can not be gotten, and that's a given
Give a real nigga the number one
Even though I got like twenty-one
Cannot be me I'm a one-of-one
Schooling your ass like 101
They been out here tryna slide on me
They been out here telling lies on me
Everybody looking out for themselves
But they still got their eyes on me
See me putting in the hard work now, ay
Momma doesn't have to call work now, ay
I decide when I start work now, ay
Problems hit the gym, they all work out
MVP, MVP, oh-nine all the way to sixteen
Even next season looking like a breeze
Lot of y'all ain't built for the league, yeah
Trade you off the team while you're in your sleep, yeah
Y'all showed me that nothing's guaranteed
And you don't know what you started
My friend's chain so big that he look like the artist
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They're still out to get me cause they never got me
Dropped outta school now we dumb rich (Dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (One shit)

83,When We Were Young,Adele,2016,Adele,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/adele/whenwewereyoung.html,"

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
It's hard to admit that
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young

84,Hide Away,Daya,2016,Daya,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/daya/hideaway.html,"

Boys seem to like the girls
Who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed
Before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys
Who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight
Hey!
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
Boys seem to like the girls
Who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy
Who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes
To be fly as a mother (Hey!)
To supply all of my heart's demands
Suit and tie cause under cover
He's gonna save my life like superman
Hey!
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Won't somebody tell me, tell me
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
(Hey!)
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
(Hey!)
Hide away, hide away
Hide away, hide away
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go[Chorus 2x:]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
(Eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh) [4x]
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side?
Standing strong as the waves roll over
When the nights are long
Longing for you to come home
All around the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go[Chorus 2x:]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on
(Eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh) [2x]
All we need is somebody to lean on
(Eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh) [2x]
All we need is somebody to lean on
Lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on...[Chorus 2x:]
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
All we need is somebody to lean on

Right or wrong if it's diss You don't mess with it
When yo bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work I don't be questioning
Where she been
Trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man that's irregular
Take her phone disconnecting her cellular
What you need that for undressing
What you need that for caressing her
Spreading her legs bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back
Go to pressing her
Trying to see who tap first made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual
It's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front do it make me a elephant
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly
Check out my etiquette
Loving my swag
Women tailor
Keep checking it
Carats they glisten in all of my necklaces
Feeling myself
Really thought it was evident
All my diamonds shine cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high
I say really really
Got money on my mind
I say really really
I look like I been balling cause I'm really balling
I won't apologize
I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lying
I say really really
I'm really out my mind
I say really really
Really really

You know just what to say
Things that scare me
I should just walk away
But I can't move my feet
The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me's changed

I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo

You hit me head on, got me weak in my knees
Yeah, something inside me's changed

Turn your magic on

Under this weight

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel

Alive again
Oh, you make me feel

Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me
And I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel

You know there's a light that glows by the front door
Don't forget the key's under the mat
When childhood stars shine
Always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your mamma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind
Hold the door, say ""please"", say ""thank you""
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb
But always stay humble and kind
When the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride
But always stay humble and kind
Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleeping with someone
And sleeping with someone you love
""I love you"" ain't no pick-up line
So always stay humble and kind
Hold the door, say ""please"", say ""thank you""
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
I know you got mountains to climb
But always stay humble and kind
When those dreams you're dreamin' come to you
When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride
But always stay humble and kind
When it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle
Shut off the AC and roll the windows down
Let that summer sun shine
Always stay humble and kind
Don't take for granted the love this life gives you
When you get where you're going don't forget turn back around
And help the next one in line
Always stay humble and kind

It's been a long day without you, my friend

Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride[Charlie Puth:]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I see you again)

Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (let me tell you)
When I see you again
(Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah[Wiz Khalifa:]
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost (and the love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone (remember me when I'm gone)
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride[Charlie Puth:]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take, will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)

And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)

The way you nibble on my ear,
The only words I wanna hear

Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje[Daddy Yankee & Justin Bieber:]

Hey, hey, hey
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's hatnin'?
You and your ass invited
So gon' and get to clappin'
Go pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami
Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio serve that scampi (Julio!)
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
Say the word and we go
You can be my freaka
Girl, I'll be a fleeko, mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave
Shopping sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now tell me who's the fairest
Is it you? (is it you?) Is it me? (is it me?)
Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like[Bridge]
If you say you want a good time
Well here I am baby, here I am baby
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind (what's on your mind)
If you want it, girl come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me, baby, tell me, tell me, baby
What you tryna do
Gold jewelry shining so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night (Sex by the fire at night)
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

[Music video version:] Wicked or weakness, you gotta see this, waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)[Regular version:] Nobody pray for me, it been that day for me, waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
Aye, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits
But now I'm counting this
Parmesan where my accountant lives in fact I'm down at this
D'usśe with my boo bae, tastes like kool aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down we playing Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M. funk
Piss out your per diem you just gotta hate em, funk
If I quit your BM I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil baby in a spiral

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
But she said, ""Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this""
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this
I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits
She said, ""Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss
I want something just like this

How much you wanna risk?

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue
But I'm OK
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them
Again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you,
I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson
OK
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop
So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner

Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn 'em inside out, I don't need no help
Got a hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can
(Body like a back road)
(Drivin' with my eyes closed)
Got braids in her hair

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain

11,Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,2017,James Arthur,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jamesarthur/sayyouwontletgo.html,"

I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told you
I think that you should get some rest
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I'll wake you up with some
Breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars
For that night
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most
I'm gonna love you 'til
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go

And your look's just the same without no make up, eh.
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of. Mama.
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up, hey

She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watching Netflix, she ain't got no cable. Okay, though.

Oh my God! She hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch you blow my high, that's like turning gold to bronze
Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie but it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God forgive me
Tunechi and finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang winning record, I'm just flexing on my exes, oh, God[Justin Bieber (DJ Khaled):]

Are you alright?
I'm alright, I'm quite alright
And my money's right
8, yeah
Countin' them bands all way to the top, 'til they be fallin' over
Countin' them bands on my way to the top, 'til we fallin' over
I don't really care if you cry
On the real you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""Baby, I am not afraid to, die""
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
Phantom that's all red
Inside all white
Like something you ride a sled down
I just want that head
My Brittany got mad
I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stacking my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like ""Come on over""
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me
I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane yeah
I might blow my brain out
Xanny help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it, I swear that it's slowing me, yeah
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""I am not afraid to, die""
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah
That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em
Medicine, little nigga take some
Fast car, Nascar, race 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas
Got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G, though
Looking at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was counting that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll
She say, ""You're the worst, you're the worst""
I cannot die, because this my universe
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you should've never lied
Should've saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""Baby, I am not afraid to, die""
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge

Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
Out the bottom, I'm a livin' proof (Super)
They compromising, half a million on the coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink Molly, I can barely move
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move

Ocean air, crusin' Biscayne
Top off, that's a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

My guillotine, drank promethazine
Tec and beams, go to those extremes
Parliament, calamari Wednesday
Parlay in Vegas, we was in attendance
Before the business, Theodore lenses
Theo-Dur prescriptions, focus on the missions
Intermission, never take a break
Switch states, touch down, foreign plates
Ain't no way, ain't no fucking way
We call the play, we didn't come to play
Rob the bank, we gon' rob the game
Again they gang, we gang, but they are not the same (Freebandz)

[Swae Lee:]
It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
It's not gonna work for you, nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, was she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peeped you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, aye
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not?
A fucking good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do[French Montana:]
Feelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me, boss
I got a hard head but her ass soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash,
Told her plank on it[Swae Lee:]
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone[French Montana:]
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi[Swae Lee:]
It's not good enough for me, since I been with you, ooh
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, was she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peeped you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone

If you loved the girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do[French Montana:]
Oh oh, you ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby, go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'mma curve my best for you, you know
So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on
Too much convo 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So, you don't ever hurt nobody
Baby girl work your body
Work your body[Swae Lee:]
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone[French Montana:]
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi[Swae Lee:]
Why not?
Oh, like we in a hurry

Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is... uh
All you have to do is stay
Won't admit what I already know
I've never been the best at letting go
I don't wanna spend the night alone
Guess I need you, and I need to
Make it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a million reasons why
But you're going, and you know that
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second

Black Beatles in the city be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike Will!
Sent flowers but you said you didn't receive them.
But you said you didn't need them.[Swae Lee:]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle
Gettin' so cold I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothing to explain
I'm a fucking black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rocking John Lennon lenses like to see 'em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screaming, ""Everybody's famous.""
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rolling
But she think she love me
I think she trollin'
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle[Gucci Mane:]
Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke hoe can only point me to a rich hoe
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light, go!
(catch up!)
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buying school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
And pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
My Chapos servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so[Swae Lee:]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle[Slim Jxmmi:]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
DnG on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like its still the 80's
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related[Swae Lee:]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me

Send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
I don't need nothing else but you
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me
This is new to you
Initially
I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you
So, don't take advantage
Don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it
So, won't you send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
I don't need nothing else but you
I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets
So, let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
I might make you mine by the night and
Send me your location
Let's focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
I don't need nothing else but you
Ride, ride, ride
Come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
I don't need nothing else but you
Ride, ride, ride
Come and vibe with me tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but you
I don't need nothing else but you

Mmm... you see, you see these fine bitches over here?

You see these trees, man? You see this water?

Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man

You damn right I'm right. I can't remember a time I was goddamn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil Boat
Hey, man, that's what I'm here for[Kyle:]
I ain't been gettin' high...
Well, maybe a little, baby, I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me girl, I don't always reply
Well, you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I noticed, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy, they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album, homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh, shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a motherfuckin' snow day
Aye, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I am just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I am in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters
I got a selfie with Oprah, I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frowned since '06
I ain't cried since '01, my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I...I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh, I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh, I...[Lil Yachty:]
She said she twenty-one, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember riding around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'mma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Whoa, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screening out the lane
Went from ""Damn, this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery
Raggy!
So, don't fuck with me. No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother, I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber[Kyle:]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I... I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

30,Scars To Your Beautiful,Alessia Cara,2017,Alessia Cara,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/alessiacara/scarstoyourbeautiful.html,"

She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause cover-girls don't cry
After their face is made
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, ""Cover-girls eat nothing""
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect
She don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
Ah, oh, ah, ah oh
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
No better you than the you that you are
(No better you than the you that you are)
No better life than the life we're living
(No better life than the life we're living)
No better time for your shine, you're a star
(No better time for your shine, you're a star)
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful
We're stars and we're beautiful
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing

I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter
I know it I know it I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it

When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there

It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did[Logic & Alessia Cara:]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?

It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now[Logic:]

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow

[The Weeknd:]
Tell me what you really like
Baby I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
You are not the single type
So baby, this the perfect time
I'm just trying to get you high
And faded off this touch
You don't need a lonely night
So baby, I can make it right
You just got to let me try
To give you what you want
You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me[The Weeknd:]
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe[Daft Punk:]
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe[The Weeknd:]
You've been scared of love
And what it did to you
You don't have to run
I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch
And it can set you free
We don't have to rush
When you're alone with me[The Weeknd & Daft Punk:]
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I know what you feel right now
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I know what you say right now, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I know what you say right now, babe

[Future:]
Hitmaka
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you[Big Sean:]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back
Don't owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me 'lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don't act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot ""count to ten"" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I'm takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back[Kanye West & Big Sean:]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh!)
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time

40,Castle On The Hill,Ed Sheeran,2017,Ed Sheeran,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/edsheeran/castleonthehill.html,"

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then
Take me back to when
I found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right
I was younger then,
Take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, ""Wow, if I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out""
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought, ""How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?""
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in
If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together

Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
We could fight a war for peace
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
We could wait until the walls come down
It's time to give a little to the
Kids in the middle, but, oh until it falls
Won't bother me
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Might've had your fill, but I feel it still

I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle
On a miracle
Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven is a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife

At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough
Know we're good enough
Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven is a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down

I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavy when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it
Moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it
So don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon
So keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on
Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
Don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it
Moving so phenomenally

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind

Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thun-thun-thunder, thunder, thunder

While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the back seat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nosebleeds

You've got a hold of me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around you
Show me an open door
Then you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying baby
Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
My pride is all I got
I'm saying baby
Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae

They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fucking horny
My mama told me, ""Kill these niggas, son. Keep it going.""
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy

She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison
Ayy, act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car
Ayy, shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band""

I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
Just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't
Baby I know that you've been wondering
Mmm, so here goes nothing
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it, mmm
There was something bout that kiss
Girl it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking
All of the things that I've been feeling
Mmm, it's time you hear em
In case you didn't know
Baby I'm crazy bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long long time ago
In case you didn't know
You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah, you're my everything
In case you didn't know
I'm crazy bout you
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You're loving on the psychopath sitting next to you
You're loving on the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You're loving on the freakshow sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think ""How did I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed

I tried to warn you just to stay away

And now they're outside ready to bust

I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a-
Bitch, your hormones probably switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy probably snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through probably offend you
This is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on-sale motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that's a riff, gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder-these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder-our DNA[Video outro:]
DNA
Gimme some ganja, gimme some ganja
DNA
Gimme some ganja
Real nigga in my DNA
Ain't no ho inside my DNA
Drippin' gold inside my DNA
Power shows inside my DNA
DNA
Gimme some ganja, gimme some ganja
Real nigga in my DNA
Ain't no ho inside my DNA

[Music video spoken intro:]
""Am I dead? Or is this one of those dreams? Those horrible dreams that seem like they last forever? If I am alive, why? Why? If there is a God or whatever, something, somewhere, why have I been abandoned by everyone and everything I've ever known? I've ever loved? Stranded. What is the lesson? What is the point? God, give me a sign, or I have to give up. I can't do this anymore. Please just let me die. Being alive hurts too much.""
Well, you almost had me fooled
Told me that I was nothing without you
Oh, and after everything you've done
I can thank you for how strong I have become
'Cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell
I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying
I'm proud of who I am
No more monsters, I can breathe again
And you said that I was done
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'Cause I can make it on my own
And I don't need you, I found a strength I've never known
I've been thrown out, I've been burned ([Live version:] I'll bring thunder, I'll bring rain)
When I'm finished, they won't even know your name
You brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell
I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying
Oh, sometimes, I pray for you at night
Oh, someday, maybe you'll see the light
Oh, some say, in life you gonna get what you give
But some things, only God can forgive
I hope you're somewhere praying, praying
I hope your soul is changing, changing
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, praying

Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie, yeah
We think we're free (Aha)
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm

Turn it up, it's your favorite song

To the rhythm
To the rhythm[Skip Marley:]
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire, ay
Up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)[Katy Perry:]
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up (turn it up, turn it up), keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie (like a wasted zombie), yeah
We think we're free (Aha)
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
It goes on and on and on

[Pharrell Williams:]
Hey!
No-nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)[Katy Perry:]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me[Pharrell Williams:]
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you? (Oh, yeah)
To memorize the way you shock me (Yeah)
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)[Katy Perry:]
Don't be afraid to catch feels (Ha)
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels (Straight up)
Feels with me (Whoa)[Big Sean:]
Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'mma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone[Katy Perry & Big Sean:]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Yeah)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (I know)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Feels with me
Don't be afraid to catch feels (No, no)
Don't be afraid, baby
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Whoa, okay)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills

I was the knight in shining armour in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate
I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, lie, lie, l-lie, I tried to hide
But now you know it

An example of the perfect candidate
Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate
I, I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken

Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine
Then you rolled in
With your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hiding
Stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes
Over whiskey on ice
Started talking bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house
But you rolled in
With your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hiding
Stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Category five
With your smile
Blew me away
And, girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside
Then you rolled in
With your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hiding
Stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane

You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I know you're thinking I'm heartless
I know you're thinking I'm cold
I'm just protecting my innocence
I'm just protecting my soul
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt
But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes

No

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, the bullets?
Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying
It'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying
Have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember, everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying
Baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, the bullets?
We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know
Stop your crying, baby
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to—we got to—away
We got to—we got to—away
We got to—we got to—away

If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh, honey, if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared
Of what I can't understand
But here I am
Next to you
The sky's more blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you, baby
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talking
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make the wish
To swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you
If three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
But here I am
Next to you
The sky's so blue
In Malibu
Next to you
In Malibu
Next to you, baby
Next to you
The sky's so blue
In Malibu, baby
Next to you
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true
In Malibu

Didn't even really wanna go
But if you get me out, you get a show
There's so many bodies on the floor
So baby we should go and add some more
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Everywhere I look are peoples' hands
Thrown up in the air to help them dance
Come on, baby, catch me if you can
I know you don't have any other plans
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Are you... down, down, d-down, down?

Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-d-d-down?
Are you... down, down, down, d-d-d-down?
You know we could put them all to shame
Now isn't the time to play it safe
Isn't this the reason why you came?
So, baby, don't you let it go to waste
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Every single thing is feeling right
Started as a quiet Friday night
I don't really think that we should fight this
What if we don't stop until it's light?
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Are you... down, down, d-down, down?

Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-d-d-down?

Kicking a habit I love even harder

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off

When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

You run your mouth all over town
And this one goes out to the sound
Of breaking glass on my Range Rover
Pay me back or, bitch, it's over
All the presents I would send
Fuck my friends behind my shoulder
Next time I'mma stay asleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And you got me thinking lately
Bitch, you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya
It go like do, re, mi, fa, so fucking done with you, girl
So fucking done with all the games you play
I ain't no tic-tac-toe

If I could go back to that day we met
I probably would've stayed in bed
You wake up everyday and make me feel like I'm incompetent
Designer shoes and Xanax tabs
Compliment your make-up bag
You never had to buy yourself a drink
'Cause everybody wanted to tap that ass sometime
And you got me thinking lately

I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it,
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight
No, no, no
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, ""Shit, this is it,"" ayy
30 for a walk through, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like ""Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold""
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, ""Can I have some to hold?""
And I can't ever tell you no
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though[Ty Dolla $ign:]
The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (hey)
Uh, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVSs, put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry[Post Malone:]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you

Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stunting, I like shining
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Bitch I'm signin'
I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body
Spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (the coupe)
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)
Yeah they call me Cardi B, I run this shit like cardio
Woo, facts
Diamond district in the chain, chain (I said I like it like that)
Certified, you know I'm gang, gang, gang, gang (I said I like it like)
Drop the top and blow the brains (I said I like it like that)
Oh he's so handsome, what's his name? (I said I like it)
Oh I need the dollars, cha-ching (I said I like it like that)

Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I can't just let you go
Oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
Take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running, dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
I can't just let you go
Oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
Looking at you I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless my objection
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just
Come over, pull me in just
Oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle, no no
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle, oh yeah
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, oh
In the middle
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby
I'm losing my mind just a little

No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but

I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead 
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead 
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache 
(Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break

Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget

Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy

Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards

Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemical all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain
Let go on the wheel, it's the bullet lane
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch I could overdose
You say, ""Stop playing it safe, girl,
I wanna see you lose control.""
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose

And wanna leave my old life behind

While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the back seat
Now I'm smiling from the stage while
You were clapping in the nosebleeds

Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""look up"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me[Lil Baby:]

You say you love me, I say you crazy
We're nothing more than friends
You're not my lover, more like a brother

Don't mess it up, talking that shit
Only gonna push me away, that's it
When you say you love me, that make me crazy

27,Bad At Love,Halsey,2018,Halsey,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/halsey/badatlove.html,"

Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's calling me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the garden state
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
That we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate
But I always make the same mistakes
Yeah, I always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with an attitude
We never told no one but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about her when I'm riding through
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
That I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy
Get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate
But I always make the same mistakes
Yeah, I always make the same mistakes 'cause
I'm bad at love
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love
Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know
I'm bad at love
I'm bad at love
I know that you're afraid
I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
Each time the feeling fades
I know that you're afraid
I'm gonna walk away
Each time the feeling fades
You know I'm bad at love
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history

D.A.
Slide on a pimp game with my pinky ring
Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain
Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift the hand
Three million cash, call me Rain Man
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's Gangland
Say the wrong words, you be hangman
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
L-l-let you down
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment
Doing everything I can, I don't wanna make you disappointed
It's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do was never tryna make an issue for you
But I guess the more you
Thought about everything, you were never even wrong in the first place, right?
Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you, with my head down lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time? That's parents for you
Very loyal?
Shoulda had my back, but you put a knife in it; my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
L-l-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
L-l-let you down
Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you
But you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt yet
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
L-l-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
L-l-let you down
Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Everytime I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me
Eventually, I bet that we
Could have made this work
And probably woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times
That didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke
Let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, I let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, let you down
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry now
Yeah I'm sorry
That I let you down

Champagne all night
Little scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila
When I taste tequila
I can kiss somebody brand new and not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory it only hits me this hard
When I taste tequila, baby I still see ya
Cutting up the floor in a sorority t-shirt
The same one you wore when we were

Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies

Attention, I'ma need you to face front
You don't want smoke with me, this is a laced blunt
Rap's Jackie Chan, we ain't pullin' them fake stunts
My crown won't fit on your bum-ass lace fronts (uh)
You bitches catchin' a fade, shout out my nigga Lil Boosie
All of your friends'll be dead, you can get hit with that Uzi
I call him Ricky, he say he love me like Lucy
Get you a straw nigga, you know this pussy is juicy
This Givenchy is custom made, now you can't get it at Saks though
I don't work in no office, but they copyin' and that's facts though
I ain't tryna be violent, but if Nicki on it, it slaps, ho
Get you lined for that paper like a loose leaf when that strap blow
I'm with a couple bad bitches that'll rip the party
If Quavo the QB, I'm Nick Lombardi
Pull up in the space coupe, I done linked with Marty
I can actually afford to get a pink Bugatti
""Hey yo Nick, didn't you just do a hit with Gotti?""
That too, but my niggas send hits like Gotti
It's a wrap, like the things on the head of a Saudi
Bitch, you my son, go and sit on the potty (rrrr)[Takeoff:]
Brand new Chanels (Chanels)
I scuffed 'em runnin' from 12 (12)
Ain't make no commitment with none of you bitches
'Cause money is treatin' me well (uh uh)
If Nicki should show me her titty
Right hand on the Bible, I swear I won't tell (swear)
If I get to play with that kitty
I wonder how many platinums we gon' sell (albums)
Pop a Perc and catch a feel (I pop one)
Now I cannot feel the wheel (whoa)
My chest bad, give me chills
And the left hand on Richard Mille (ice)
Not the watch, but the price on the ice
If you don't know what that is (huh)
Motorsport, motorville
Abort the mission, that's a kill (pew, pew, brrr)[Quavo:]
Motorsport, yeah, put that thing in sports (skrrt, skrrt)
Shawty bad (bad), pop her like a cork (pop it)
You a dork, never been a sport (dork, yeah)
Pull up, woo, woo, jumpin' out the court (jump)
Cotton candy (drink), my cup tastes like the fair (cotton)
Straight up there (where?), we didn't take the stairs (where?)
Faced my fears (fears), gave my mama tears (mama)
Shiftin' gears (shift), on the Nawf, get serious (serious)
Girl, yeah, yeah, I wish my grandma could see me (grandma)
Take away pain, ain't easy (pain)
That's why I fire up a bleezy (fire)
Niggas not cappin' this season

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of them
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system of catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Go down that road again

I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again
It's all the same (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey[Kendrick Lamar:]
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that's what it gotta be[The Weeknd:]
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?

Thought that I could chase you with the cold evening

Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it, even though I do (even though I do)

I know it's forward but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to

If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playing and re-playing old conversations
Over-thinking every word and I hate it

And what's the point in hiding
Everybody knows we got unfinished business
And I regret it if I didn't say this isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

I bought a franchise to double up the profits (franchise)
We make a land slide, chopper get to popping (landslide)
Eliott got me rocky
Blow a socket, chicken teriyaki (brr)
Take off rocket, keep 'em in pocket
Water gon' lock it, quadruple the profit (profit)
I walk like I walk (hey) talk like I talk (woah)
What's in my vault? Load of cash and assaults (brr!)
I put a lab in my loft (lab)
She cook up and jab with the fork (jab)
By the pair, I got karats that choke (by the pair)
By the pair, I got karats each lobe (by the pair)
Private life, private jets 'round the globe (private life)
Hit a bitch, hit a lick with the 'cho (hey)[Quavo:]

Walk it, walk it like I talk it (talk it), walk it like I talk it (woo)

Ain't no walkie-talkie (no)
This some, ""You know, why don't we know?"" (We know?)
Hold out on that coffee
Smoke the cookie, get the coughing
Drop-dead fresh, I need a coffin
Balling, something we do often (ball)
Take the pot and I'm splashing up, dolphin (splash)
I take the nine and go buy me a faucet (nine)
Walk it like I talk it, a nigga done bought it (uh)
I play the coach so I gotta call it (call it)
Up in the shits, some niggas just dormant (shits)
Walk in the building, they start applauding (applauding)

[Halsey:]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover I'd never lie
He said, ""Be true,"" I swear, ""I'll try.""
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love; the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I[G-Eazy (Halsey):]
My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide
2017 Bonnie and Clyde
Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she take the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber, never would no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars, or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince
You know[Halsey (G-Eazy):]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover I'd never lie
I love you baby
He said, ""Be true,"" I swear, ""I'll try.""
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love; the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I[Halsey:]
Him and I
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
In the end, it's him and I[G-Eazy (Halsey):]
It's her and I mobbin' 'til the end of time
Only one who gets me, I'm a crazy fuckin' Gemini
Remember this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie
My funeral will be lit if I
Ever go down or get caught, if they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keep that thang-thang, if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (together)
Fuck up clubs together (together)
And we'd both go crazy (crazy)
If we was to sever
You know?
We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich
You know?[Halsey:]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover I'd never lie
He said, ""Be true,"" I swear, ""I'll try.""
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love; the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
In the end, it's him and I
Cross my heart, hope to die
To you I've never lied
For you I'd take a life
It's him and I, and I swear[G-Eazy:]
'Til the end I'm-ma ride with you
Mob and get money, get high with you[Halsey:]
Cross my heart, hope to die
This is our ride or die
You can confide in me
There is no hiding, I swear[G-Eazy:]
Stay solid, never lie to you
Swear, most likely I'mma die with you[Halsey:]
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover I'd never lie
He said, ""Be true,"" I swear, ""I'll try.""
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you[SZA:]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer[Kendrick Lamar:]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you[SZA:]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin' like ya involved, like a rebound
Got no end game, got no reason
Got to stay down, it's the way that you making me feel
Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
You kinda feeling like you're tryna get away from me
If you do, I won't move
I ain't just cryin' for no reason
I ain't just prayin' for no reason
I give thanks for the days, for the hours
And another way, another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we're runnin' out of time[Kendrick Lamar & SZA:]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you[SZA:]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Cuando yo la vi
Dije: ""si esa mujer fuera para mi""
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir
Estás dura, dura, dura, dura, dura
Que estás dura, mano arriba porque tú te ves bien
Estás dura mamacita, te fuiste de nivel
Dura, mira como brilla tu piel
Estás dura, dímelo dímelo ¿cómo es que es?
Estás dura, yo te doy un veinte de diez
Estás dura, dura, dura
Tu eres la máquina, la máquina de baile
Si no tiene a nadie vente pa' mi' brazos, caile
Ese perfume se siente en el aire
Algo como Argentina, tú me traes los Buenos Aires
Está poderosa, media escandalosa
Habrán muchas mujeres pero tú eres otra cosa
Si fuera un delito eso de que estás hermosa
Te arresto en mi cama y te pongo las esposas
Tienes el toque, toque, toque
Miren el material, edición especial
Tienes el toque, toque, toque
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir
Estás dura, dura, dura, dura, dura
Que estás dura prendre rifa porque tú te ves bien
Estás dura mamacita, te fuiste de nivel
Dura, mira como brilla tu piel
Estás dura, dímelo dímelo ¿cómo es que es?
Estás dura, yo te doy un veinte de diez
Estás dura, dura, dura
Me gusta como mueve ese ram pam pam
Mi mente maquineando en un plan plan plan
Si me deja, en esa curva le doy pam pam
Cuál es tu receta no sé, esta pa' comerte bien
Me gusta como mueve ese ram pam pam
Mi mente maquineando en un plan plan plan
Si me deja, en esa curva le doy pam pam
Tu belleza retumba, las otras pa' la tumba
Uno, dos y tres vamo' a darle
La envidia que se calle
Saludos a todas las nenas que paralizan la calle
¿Cómo tú te llamas? ¿de dónde tu eres?
Dame el número pare entrar contigo en detalles
Y tienes el toque, toque, toque
Pareces una estrella formando el alboroto
Tienes el toque, toque, toque
Se cae el internet cuando subes una foto
Cuando yo la vi
Dije: ""si esa mujer fuera para mi""
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir
Estás dura, dura, dura, dura, dura
Que estás dura, mano arriba porque tú te ves bien
Estás dura mamacita, te fuiste de nivel
Dura, mira como brilla tu piel
Estás dura, dímelo dímelo ¿cómo es que es?
Estás dura, yo te doy un veinte de diez
Estás dura, dura, dura
Tú tienes el size, otra como tu mami no hay
Pégate, dale boom bye bye
Que tú tienes el size, otra como tú mami no hay
Pégate, dale boom bye bye
Que tú tienes el size, otra como tú mami no hay

Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin so good just to hurt me
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning
Mercy
Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning
Cause it's still burning
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
Make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy
If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone
Please don't call me
And say you miss me
No
If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
Make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy
Woah
Oh have mercy
If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
If you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
Make this fast

96,One Number Away,Luke Combs,2018,Luke Combs,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lukecombs/onenumberaway.html,"

Are you sitting at home all alone trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Maybe playing some Mayer getting lost in your favorite lines?
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice
I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dialing up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite song?
Maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, on the moving on
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door
And I'm one number away from calling you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dialing up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all?
We don't have to talk, I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away from calling you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dialing up, every thing I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Away

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
You have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love, so you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry
But it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
So I cut you off

Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh ooh
The master of my sea, oh ooh

Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh let the bullets fly, oh let them rain

Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh ooh
Your spirit up above, oh ooh
I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh ooh
The blood in my veins, oh ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and rained down

You don't have to say just what you did (what you did)
I already know (I know)

So tell me, how's it feel? (oh-woah)
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me

Baby, I'm the one who put you up there

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please, I do
What I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along
With me but she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at being bad
Bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad
That you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean
I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad guy

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're OK
Now if we jump together at least we can swing
Far away from the wreck we made
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier
I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier
I want you to be happier
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Yeah
Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things
Yeah
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing
My wrist, stop watchin'
My neck is flossy
Make big deposits
My gloss is poppin'
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yeah
Wearin' a ring but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, ""Which one?"" I say, ""Nah, I want all 'em""
Happiness is the same price as ""red-bottoms""
My smile is beamin'
My skin is gleamin'
The way it shine
I know you've seen it
You've seen it
I bought a crib
Just for the closet
Both his and hers
I want it, I got it
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it
Baby
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks! Just bought it
Oh, yeah
I see it, I like it
I want it, I got it
Yep
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black Card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag
But I be like, ""Put it in the bag""
Yeah
When you see them racks
They stacked up like my ass
Yeah
Shoot
Go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop
Gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothin' but net when we shoot
Look at my neck
Look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it then that's what I get
Yeah
I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it

Girl I know you had a long day
You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' there watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at the fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it
Yeah, as cool at it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at the fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it
Yeah, it's a little cold outside
The music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leavin' now
Girl, I'm so glad, I'm so glad
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at the fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it

Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
The way that Gucci look on you amazing
But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
You're saying you're the one for me, I need to face it
Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out
Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else said I'd be under
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
No, no, no
Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know
The way that dress fall off you is amazing
Love a miracle, a beautiful creation
Baby, come a little closer let me taste it
You came a little closer, now you're shaking
Never ever gon' mislead you
Don't believe the lies they feed you
Stop and stare like a sculpture
Painted in your colors
Beautiful, beautiful life right now
Beautiful, beautiful night right now
Beautiful, beautiful by my side right now, yeah
Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know

We've been to both Carolina's
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down the coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But I ain't got much memory of the scenes come to think
I miss them all every damn time
It's all your fault
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God I saw
All I needed too
Might as well have stayed in the room
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no I didn't care
Cause baby you were there
And once again
Couldn't help but stare
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah you guessed it girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you

I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night

Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself, to myself
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah

Man, what? (Haha)
This shit funny
I was like-
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, ""You loved me first"" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, ""Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time they're insecure""
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)

So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past (Past)

But I cannot reverse it
You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)

Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
We couldn't turn around till we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I couldn't be there even when I try
You don't believe it, we do this every time
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bales out the box

Had to put the stick in a box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, got the Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at
I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin' ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forget it

If you don't wanna see me
Did a full one eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all
So if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all
So if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Don't come out
Don't show up
Don't start now

Woo, woo
I pull up like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, Seth in the kitchen)
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)[DaBaby (Roddy Ricch):]

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote[DaBaby:]

Brown skin and lemon over ice
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna tell you something

We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright

We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, although we both try
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter

I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound til I come back around
For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here

And gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur

I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Hanging on to a guy, and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night, all alone, waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And, baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about
Forget and take her on a first date again

13,Whats Poppin,"Jack Harlow Featuring DaBaby, Tory Lanez & Lil Wayne",2020,Jack Harlow,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jackharlow/whatspoppinremix.html,"

Back with the remix
These boys all my sons like Phoenix (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
My city and state never ever seen this
Jimmy Neutron, I'm a young boy genius (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
On the futon, I'ma give her that penis
When this shit's done I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, like Gilbert Arenas, shoot my shot
I'm still with the demons, ooh, I keep it thorough
I got five chicks in New York
That means one in each borough
I'm in the pocket like Burrow
When I'm back home, though
They treat me like Robert De Niro
Took her to Taco Bell, bought her a churro
Took her home, gave her a cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year old
Zeros on zeros on zeros (Zeros)
That's what my back account balance say (Woo)
I got a check from the shoe company
Now I do anything that New Balance say
I bought her a plane ticket, out of state
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Said, ""I'm in town today""
She said she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' that shit
So when she pull up on me I know what she 'bout to say
What's poppin'?
Brand new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin' (Oh, these niggas got me fucked up, nigga)
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (Ooh, you know, it's like)
My body got rid of them toxins (Let me go, mmh, mmh)
SportsCenter, top ten
Call up my bitch, tell her, ""Bring me that noggin"" (Brrt)
Brain real good, she a scholar
I like the thing with low mileage, good brain with no college
Call me DaBaby, no toddler (Wah)
I'm real creative and stylish, F&N in my denim
I send a hit, make him spin 'em
And I just flew back from LA on the jet yesterday (Yeah)
I go back and forth like I play tennis
I fuck with your ho, yeah, I'm fit for it
Still on the Billboard, the number one song and you can't
And I done got so fuckin' rich, all these hoes on my dick
I still don't give a fuck what you say
She eat it like a Pac Man, nigga (Eat it)
Whoop a nigga like I'm Batman, nigga (Eat it)
I just pulled up in the Batmobile (Nyoom)
The reason I ain't fuckin' with these rap-ass niggas
'Cause they cap-ass niggas (Cap)
And they raps ain't real (Cap)
Believe me, you wanna keep your life, then take it easy
I'm rockin' water diamonds, need a Squeegee
These niggas watered down, they drinkin' Fiji
My whip is orange and brown like I'm in Cleveland
My bitch is Mello Yello like a soda (Soda)
These niggas tattletalers, I'm a soldier
Ayy, somebody tell them niggas that it's over
You know it's Baby, nigga
What's poppin'? (Poppin')
Brand new whip, just hopped in (Woo, hahaha)
I got options (Ayy)
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (Uh)
Hop out that scat and I called out
I'm out here with somebody daughter
She callin' me daddy, I'm somebody father
I gotta go gets it, or when I go kiss it
I put my lips on it like somebody water
The diamond, the glacier, the cut, it all wylin'
She pulled up to fuck me but nobody caught her
She told me that she wasn't feelin' my music
I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I with the chiefski, I need that shit for the freeski
We are not buyin' no pussy you sellin' on Peach Street
It's so much work on my celly
I had to go tell all my bitches, ""Email it to reach me""
All in my DM, I'll follow your BM
She play with the croski, we used to fuck on the lowski
She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski (Hahaha), nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had a semi as long as a ruler in case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the mixtape and came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so rude that she cough up a lung again
Five star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again
I just put so many pennies on the watch
That I don't ever got to stunt again, nigga, lil' Tory
What's poppin'? (Canada)
Brand new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')

Picture perfect, you don't need no filter

Stay in the kitchen, cooking up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Shout out to your mom and dad for making you
Standing ovation, they did a great job raising you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter

Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now

Get that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow

18,Everything I Wanted,Billie Eilish,2020,Billie Eilish,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/billieeilish/everythingiwanted.html,"

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might have been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly
So I stepped off the golden
Nobody cried
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say
As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
""They don't deserve you""
I tried to scream
But my head was under water
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say
As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
""They don't deserve you""
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you 
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone 
All I hear were the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind could make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind could make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down
Maybe I guess we'll never know
You know 
You know
Before you go
Was there something I could've said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind could make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Speeding fast on the run, never want to get caught up

Swore that I'd never forget, don't think I'm just talking

When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
What's your favorite song? Does it make you smile?
Do you think of me?
When you close your eyes
Tell me what are you dreaming?
Everything, I wanna know it all
I'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there but I'm gonna try
If it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh)
Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
When you think about your forever now
Do you think of me?
When you close your eyes
Tell me what are you dreaming?
Everything, I wanna know it all
I'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there but I'm gonna try
If it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh)
I'm gonna love you
Ooh, want the good and the bad
Everything in between
Ooh, gotta cure my curiosity
Ooh yeah, I'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours (Yeah, sweet heart of yours)
And I might never get there but I'm gonna try (Yeah)
If it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh)
I'm gonna love you, yeah (Ooh)
And I'm (Do you love the rain? Does it make you dance)
Gonna love you (I'm gonna love)

[Repeating:]
There's some whores in this house
I said (hold up), certified freak
Seven days a week
wet-ass pussy
Make that pull-out game weak
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fucking with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a Kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's role play, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack Truck
Right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring
Gobble me, swallow me
Drip down inside of me
Quick jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be
I run down on him 'fore I have a nigga running me
Talk your shit, bite your lip
Ask for a car while you ride that dick
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang
He already made his mind up 'fore he came
Now get your boots and your coat
For this wet-ass pussy
He bought a phone just for pictures
Of this wet-ass pussy
Pay my tuition just to kiss me
On this wet-ass pussy
Now make it rain if you wanna
See some wet-ass pussy
Look, I need a hard hitter, I need a deep stroker
I need a Henny drinker, I need a weed smoker
Not a garden snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1, just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that little dangly thing
That swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's going in dry and it's coming out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo!
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheating
Put him on his knees, give him something to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm looking for a beating
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat you
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom feeder
Big D stand for ""big demeanor""
I could make you bust before I ever meet you
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask, ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fucking with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop
That's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop
That's some wet-ass pussy
I'm talking WAP, WAP, WAP
That's some wet-ass pussy
Macaroni in a pot
That's some wet-ass pussy

(Get it together (Together))
Mustard on the beat, ho
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty
All these designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hop inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe
Either you from Yah Gang or you're SuWoop
Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
And I'm that nigga now, who knew?
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep

I been wakin' up to get the money, woah, woah
Got a bad bitch, her ass tatted, woah, woah
Givenchy to my toes, two twins, I'm fucking 'em both
I put in a new AP, the water like a boat
I was down bad on my dick, where was you niggas at?
I know you turned your back on me just to get some racks
I see you swerve back, 'cause I'm in the black 'Bach
New diamonds on me, fuck a flash, this ain't Snapchat
'Cause I been gettin' paid
Yellow diamonds on me look like lemonade
Got my baby mama that new Bentayga
Tryna get the dojo like a sensei, yeah
Rolls Royce umbrellas when I'm in the rain
I just mind my business
I got brothers that did the time, I ain't kiddin'
All these rappers just talk about it, I live it
Goin' up, I ain't got no sky limit, yeah, yeah, yeah

Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodging death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feeling sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been running through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models getting faded in the compound
Tryna love me but they never get a pulse down
(Why?) 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man but I'm heartless
Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be falling out the pocket
Metro Boomin, turn this hoe into a mosh pit
Tesla pill got me flying like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watching
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffel bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone and Bazaar now
Selling dreams to these girls with their guard down (what?)
Seven years I've been swimming with the sharks now
(Why?) 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless

Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

I tried to always do right (Do right)
I thought I lost you this time (Time)
You just came back in my life (My life)
You never gave up on me (Why don't you)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you)
I don't do well when alone (Oh, yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone
'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless

33,Break My Heart,Dua Lipa,2020,Dua Lipa,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dualipa/breakmyheart.html,"

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I woulda known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I woulda known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no (Oh no), I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Oh wait, you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those good bye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that

Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ay

Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shorty came back and said she didn't mean it

Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it
When you call me Señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say, ""We're just friends.""
But friends don't know the way you taste-la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time comin'
Don't you let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop
I love it when you call me Señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it
When you call me Señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya
All along I'll be coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya
Call my name, I'll be comin' for ya (comin' for ya)
Comin' for ya (comin' for ya)
For ya, for ya (oh, she loves it when I call her), for ya
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

I got room
In my fumes (Yeah!)
She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (It's lit!)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)
She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone
I see some things that you might fear
""I'm doing a show, I be back soon"" (Soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (No)
Now I got her in my room (Uh)
Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom
Hope we make it outta here
When I'm with you I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah!)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side
'Case it's fumes (Smoke)
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up!)
I'm the highest in the room (It's lit!)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)
We ain't stressing 'bout the loot
My block made that caserío
This not the Molly this the boot
Ain't no coming back from here
Live the life of La Familia
It's so much gang that I can't see ya
Turn it up till they can't hear (They can't)
Running, running 'round for the thrill
Yeah, dog, dog 'round my real (Damn!)
Raw, raw, I've been pouring to the rim (Drank)
Naw, naw, naw, they not back of the VIP (In the VIP)
Gorgeous, baby keep me hard as steel
Ah, this my life I did not choose
Huh, been on this since we was kids
We gon' stay on top and break the rules
Uh, fill my mind up with ideas
'Case it's fumes
She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up!)
I'm the highest in the room (I'm the highest, it's lit!)
Hope I make it outta here (Outta here)
I'm the highest, you might got the Midas touch
The brightest and my bitch the vibiest
I'm excited, everything I do is exciting, now
Play with giants, little bit too extravagant

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please, I do
What I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along
With me but she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at being bad
Bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad
That you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean
I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad guy

Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view[Iann dior:]
I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feeling bad
Baby, I am not your dad, it's not all you want from me
I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused
And you love startin' it, now I'm in a mood
Now we're arguin' in my bedroom
We play games of love to avoid the depression
We've been here before
And I won't be your victim[24kGoldn:]
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new

Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
So why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talking slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
You keep playing, not another day with you shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well you better save it for me[Iann dior:]
We play games of love to avoid the depression
We've been here before
And I won't be your victim[24kGoldn:]
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules

""I don't know how you get down with them clowns, but I'm a soldier""
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression (Brrt)
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin' one day I'd find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin' not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

I've been having dreams
Jumping on a trampoline
Flipping in the air
I never land just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to falling leaves
Now they're right upon me
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
I've been having dreams
Splashing in a summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushing weight of paradise
Solid block of gold
Lying in the cold
I feel right at home
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

I was distracted
And in traffic
I didn't feel it
When the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin'
Were you out drinkin'
Were you in the living room
Chillin' watchin' television
It's been a year now
Think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out
I know you know we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know you know we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending
You'd come over right
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
Right?
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
Right?
I tried to imagine
Your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin'
That night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house
And didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah it's been a year now
Think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out
And I know you know we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know you know we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending
You'd come over right
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
The sky'd be falling while I'd hold you tight
No there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
You'd come over right
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over right
I know you know we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know you know we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending

Standing up, keep me on a rise
Lost control of myself, I'm compromised
You're incriminated, no disguise
And you ain't never running low on supplies
Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it
Hundred racks, help me spend it, babe
Light a match, get litty, babe
That jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah
Rollin' eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum

That yummy, yummy (And you stay flexing on me)
Yeah, you got that yummy, yum

Hop in the Lambo', I'm on my way
Drew House slippers on with a smile on my face
I'm elated that you are my lady
You got the yum, yum, yum, yum
You got the yum, yum, yum, whoa
Whoa-ooh

59,One Man Band,Old Dominion,2020,Old Dominion,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/olddominion/onemanband.html,"

Been flying solo for so long
Nobody's singing a harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass, no guitar, no tambourine
And I found you like a melody
You were singing in the same key as me
We had 'em dancing in the streets
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone alone
Putting miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
I don't wanna be a one man band
No
I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues
If I'm gonna be famous
Girl, I wanna be famous with you
We got our own little groove
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone alone
Putting miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band
When the spotlight goes cold, the curtains come down
The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's payin', we'll still be playin'
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone alone
Putting miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a one man band

I said, ""Hell no, I don't""
She said, ""Do you really think I'm where you belong?""

You're perfect for me
Everything I'll ever need

What I'm sayin'
When I got what I got I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind you might think there's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got, girl, I don't
I said, ""Baby, do you know you sound a little crazy,
When you're talkin' like that, girl?""
Ain't no second thoughts, no regrets, no kinda maybe
No wishin' I'd turn back
Before you came along
I could go on and on
Girl, just kiss me
You're all that I want
When I got what I got I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind you might think there's somethin' more I want

[Forrest:]
Feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
Everyday can be a better day despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance
I just say whatever cause there is no way around it cause
Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh
It's okay, it's okay
Feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
Somedays you wake up and nothing works you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears just like the waves and sound did
And just say whatever cause there is no way around it
Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh
It's okay, it's okay
Feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
Feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best

Ugh, you're a monster
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the (Ayy)
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster, yeah
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster, yeah
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
(Godzilla, fire spitter), monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
(Fire, Godzilla, fire), monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
(Godzilla, fire spitter), monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
(Fire, Godzilla, fire), monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause every Tom and Dick
And Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
On 'em swearing up and down, they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi, single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
Or be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowing up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl
I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha

Black mascara off a pillow case
Cure a one-too-many headache

This weekend or next
And hey, how do you get a red-wine stain out of your favorite dress?
How does he sleep at night? 
Mamma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mamma, can you die from a broken heart?
Can you ask daddy if he's got time to come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything and keep that pistol in the drawer
Mamma, please don't say 
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away
How does he sleep at night? 
Mamma, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mamma, can you die from a broken heart?

Can your knees give out from praying so hard?
Can you go blind from crying in the dark?
Was it ever really real
If he don't feel like I feel?
How does he sleep at night?

To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?

Girl you're looking so good, it's driving me out of mine
Aw you're breaking my heart
Baby you're playing hard to forget
Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch on the swing

But it's a whole lot of hurt

Just to mess with my head
So much for so long, out of sight, out of mind
Girl you're looking so good, it's driving me out of mine
Aw you're breaking my heart
Baby you're playing hard to forget
There stands the glass
That-that will ease all my pain
That-that will settle my brain
It's-it's my first one today
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey but I've got no proof
That you showed up tonight in that dress
Just to mess with my head
So much for so long, out of sight, out of mind
Girl you're looking so good, it's driving me out of mine
Aw you're breaking my heart
Baby you're playing hard to forget
Aw honey I'm falling apart
You're playing hard to forget

Everybody here ain't from here
But we're here doin' our thing
Lettin' go a little, little by little
Sippin' on a frozen drink
Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces a-shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
Hey Señorita, don't you think we need
A salt and a Buffett song
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita
We'll be gone
Ice blue skies, shades on the eyes
To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long
But who cares, we got all day
Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn a-screamin'
But we'll all be alright, after
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
Hey Señorita, don't you think we need
A salt and a Marley song
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita
We'll be gone
We'll be gone
Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces a-shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, feelin' no pain
It goes like
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
Hey Señorita, don't you think we need
A salt and a Chesney song
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita
We'll be gone
We'll be gone
We'll be gone

Day trip took it to 10 (Hey)
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie

Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me? I
I thought you want this for my life
For my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive
You lied
Just say to me
What you want from me

So what happened, what's the meaning? I
I thought you want this for my life
For my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive
You lied
Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan

But I need you to
Say to me

Just say to me

Wheezy outta here
Hot, hot, hot, hot

Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot[Gunna:]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot

Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock[Young Thug:]
Cash, money, checks, cash
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos
I just wanna fuck the bitch by myself
I just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite
I took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)
I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)
Ayy, man, this synthetic weed you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm in the coupe by myself
I had to kick a door when I was 5
Keep the awards on the shelf
Whole sixteen round in the fire
I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys
Yeah, Cartier eyes
Cartier coat, Cartiers the watch
Cartier love, Cartier the thot
Cartier specs, buffalo on the side
Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot
Sky Wrangler coupe with two hundred the dash
Cartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag
Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way I'ma go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out
I just whip up a new Chanel Patek
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out
Turn the whole top floor to a whorehouse
Hundred racks in ones, dude brought the flood out[Young Thug:]

It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said ""I don't love you"" a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better
I hope you find what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now
Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was what you wanted
Well I guess you found what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope you're happy now
I hope you find what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get moving on, all figured out

A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that love to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry

Suicidal
Your love is suicidal
Lately I've been feeling suicidal
Your love is suicidal
I thought that we were meant to be
You took my heart and made it bleed
I gave you all my ecstasy
I know you'll be the death of me (Keep it Z3N)
Left lipstick on my Hennessy
Felt like you took my soul from me
You gave me all your ecstasy
I thought that we were meant to be
Your love is suicidal
For me, your love is suicidal
To me, your love is suicidal (Ooh)
To me, your love is suicidal
Sippin' on this Hennessy, once you were my friend
Now you turned into my enemy, here we go again
I think love is just like money how it blows in the wind
Got me taking medicine, these is not no vitamins
I thought that we were meant to be
'Til you struck out like one, two, three
The thought of you was heavenly
At first, now it's where Hell will be
Oh, I've been balling on my own, shawty, sipping fours
Pour it in a twenty, make it strong, shawty, gripping poles
Catch your new lil' nigga and it's on, shawty, I'ma blow
Hit him with the Ruger and it's too silent, make it go (Shh)
Do him bogus, make his heart hurt, that's what love is
You're leaving me for him, are you on drugs, bitch?
I know you are, 'cause you're never Perc'-less, so perfect
I thought that we were meant to be
You took my heart and made it bleed
I gave you all my ecstasy
I know you'll be the death of me
Left lipstick on my Hennessy
Felt like you took my soul from me
You gave me all your ecstasy
I thought that we were meant to be
Your love is suicidal
For me, your love is suicidal
To me, your love is suicidal (Ooh)
To me, your love is suicidal
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh
I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh
I don't wanna lose my conscience
Drinkin' all this Hennessy
But, baby, you took control of me
And I got too many enemies
I knew you wanted to fuck him 'cause I could tell
Your love is suicidal
For me, your love is suicidal
To me, your love is suicidal (Ooh)
To me, your love is suicidal
Huh, ooh, I'm pissin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh
Then flush it in the past, then fornicate with cash
I'm tryna heal the gash, you up and made a slash, then left (Oh)
You tell your friends I was the worst even though it isn't true
You actin' out your body, baby, I know it isn't you
Seen you feel ridiculed when you played me like a fool

76,The Bigger Picture,Lil Baby,2020,Lil Baby,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lilbaby/thebiggerpicture.html,"

Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd
(Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they wanna see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrest
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)
Trade my 4x4 for a G63
Ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance, and chance again
I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you
And know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving, they killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb
And all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart
I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better
You gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones
To carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
Cause I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
Gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope
But I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did cause I didn't have no choice or no hope
I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
They trainin' officers to kill us
Then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness
I know that I'm gifted, I won't go too deep
Cause I'm scared they'll get me, ain't scared to admit it
Some shit I can't mention it's people who can
Well, here's the chance, I won't take the stand
But I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here

I ain't tryna have babies right now, so we fuck with the rubber, but I got a raw bitch
Know this money bring envy, you probably wan' be me, but bro, we can't beef 'bout no small shit
Overseas, got the crowd doin' moshpits
Can't believe that I'm still in the 'partments
Businessman, went and got me an office
Million dollar deals, I get 'em often
Me and Dolla was servin' on Sparks Street
Hot lil' jit, he gon' stay with the chopstick
I got robbed, that shit made me a monster
Eviction notice, my sister, my mamas
Now they houses as big as they want 'em
I done ran up them motherfuckin' commas, look at lil' Dominique
Livin' like we in a race, I might come in first or second, but I won't ever be last
Lately I been in my bag
Bro told me don't take my foot off the gas
If they give you a inch, go'n and take you a mile
I'ma shoot by myself like a technical foul
City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop us some bottles
I took the lead and let everyone follow
They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, ""I can't""
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you, I run with them snakes

I want to start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry
I feel so sad
I tried to help you
It just made you mad
And I had no warning
About who you are
I'm just glad I made it out
Without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause, no, I've had enough of them
Let me start this off by saying
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts
But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you
Oh, I feel so sorry
I feel so sad
I tried to help you
It just made you mad
And I had no warning
About who you are
Just glad I made it out without breaking down
Oh, and I feel so sorry
I feel so sad
I tried to help you
It just made you mad
And I had no warning
About who you are
About who you are
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
'Cause you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you

Yeah I'm a turner
I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at
34 was bad
So I just turn to 35
Yeah I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wild card up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Well I'm a giver
Yeah and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I've made an art
Out of forgetting 'em well
Yeah I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused
And I start to lose
I'll rhyme a dime till it all makes sense
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wild card up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll turn a light on in my soul
And keep the bluebird in my heart
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wild card up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons
I just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Keep a bluebird in my heart
And the bluebird sings

Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, uh
I can't breathe (Chopsquad), I can't breathe, 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh, well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like an anvil
Perky got me itching like an anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine
But I'm lying, I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh, well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
It's stress on my shoulders like an anvil
Perky got me itching like an anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me
This is the part where I tell you I'm fine
But I'm lying, I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me
I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh, well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail

93,Does To Me,Luke Combs Featuring Eric Church,2020,Luke Combs,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/lukecombs/doestome.html,"

I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
There's a worn-out blade that my Granddaddy gave me
My Mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me

96,More Than My Hometown,Morgan Wallen,2020,Morgan Wallen,https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/morganwallen/morethanmyhometown.html,"

Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know
That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost soul found, Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that
I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost soul found, Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em
'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more, baby, love you more

Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind, spinnin' again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
And some broken-in cowboy boots
But I'm in love with lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junky for your midnight moves
I'm in love with lovin' on you
I like a sunrise, duck blind
Birdie on a par five
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth
But I'm in love with lovin' on you
Feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junky for your midnight moves
I'm in love with lovin' on you
Girl, I'm in love with lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you honey
You're right on the money

You always wear them glasses
You don't wanna let no sucka look you in your eyes, huh?
Better show off them eyelashes
You love what you do with a passion
Oh that shit attractive
I fuck with you girl
All you wanna do is gas me
How we end up in the backseat?
Just tryna get to the bag
We on the same page, you the same way
Only keep the fam' around me
So let me know what it's gon' be
I don't plan on gettin' no sleep, while we
Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', ""Money ain't a thing""
We up till six in the mornin'
When the sunrise we'll be on it
Know I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' stop
Everywhere we go, slide, hey, hey
Up all night, baby, when we goin' slide?
Oh, yeah, yeah
Baby when we goin'
Slide, slide, slide, oh yeah, slide, oh

Nothin' matters when we one on one
Lookin' at us 'cause we goin' dumb
We on the same wave, you the same way
You know I be down if it's with you
Where we goin'? Baby, what's the move?
We should take a trip up to the moon
Get a room

This city talkin' with a large mouth

Used to side with me 'cause you be trippin' when you miss me

Ay, still doing drive-bys, but I want to walk 'em

Pay my dog a dime to walk him down, he need the racks bitch
